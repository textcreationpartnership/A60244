            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Robert Deniſon TO THE Moſt Worthy and Learned J. H.</head>
            <p>THis little <hi>Gift,</hi> which, being not long ſince at <hi>Paris,</hi> I received from a moſt <hi>Eminent Divine</hi> of that City, I bequeath, moſt <hi>worthy Sir,</hi> to You, as knowing well how ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for many Years you have bent your Studies to this ſort of Learning.</p>
            <p>The enſuing <hi>Treatiſe</hi> was taken out of the Large Critical Hiſtory of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> Written Originally in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tongue; which Original the<note place="margin">F. Simmon.</note> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour was lately thinking to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed himſelf. For the <hi>French</hi> Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:50875:3"/>which is common in every bodies Hand, is only a Compendium of the Latin, that has not yet ſeen the Light; and was indeed deſign'd for Perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to that Language, who as they are more Nice and Curious, ſo they are ſoon tir'd with what is long and tedious. Nevertheleſs I could wiſh that Work had been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated entire to us, who are not ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and delicate; for we do not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reject thoſe <hi>Things</hi> that are good; but tho it could not be obtained from that moſt laborious <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Animadverſions:</hi> Yet a <hi>Pariſian</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, both <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> who had then ſome thoughts of ſetting forth a <hi>Bible</hi> compleatly furniſhed, beſtowed it in <hi>pure Friendſhip</hi> upon Us, whatever it be, which he aſſured me he received from the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Critics,</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted among the reſt of thoſe <hi>Additions</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50875:3"/>deſigned for the <hi>Bible,</hi> which he was then intending to publiſh: For, <hi>moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sir,</hi> the Study of <hi>Critical Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> is not yet grown ſo cold among the <hi>Pariſian Divines,</hi> but that in our <hi>Age,</hi> there are yet ſome moſt Learned <hi>Perſons</hi> among them, who contemning the <hi>Trifles</hi> and <hi>Idle Subtleties</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi> handle that <hi>Art</hi> with ſingular Succeſs, as being eminently skilled both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew Languages.</hi> In the number of theſe is He, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly Communicated to me theſe <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Enquiries,</hi> into the various for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that has befallen the Bible, through the diverſity of Times and Places. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps moſt learned Sir, that <hi>Pariſian</hi> Divine may ſeem to you to have fallen ſomewhat too ſeverely upon our moſt Excellent <hi>Voſſius.</hi> But if thoſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Opinions, which he lays to the Charge of our moſt Learned <hi>Voſſius,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50875:4"/>be but attentively conſidered, you ſhall not find him to have exceeded the Laws of Moderation and Equity. But I need ſay no more to recommend to you, ſo Knowing and Judicious in this kind of Learning, the Reading of this little Treatiſe: For I remember how highly you valu'd, reſiding in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Wit, the Learning and Judgment of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Critica Sacra,</hi> tho other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe little known to you at that time, then by his <hi>Writings.</hi> And indeed ſuch is the <hi>Genius,</hi> worthy Sir, with which you came into the World, that what is good you approve, what is right and true you applaud, even in Men who differ from us in their Religion and Forms of VVorſhip. Therefore if there be any thing too ſharply uttered in that ſame <hi>Author,</hi> or which may ſeem not to comply with the General Doctrine of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> you know
<pb facs="tcp:50875:4"/>him to be one of thoſe who profeſſes the Faith of the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> In the mean time accept this little Preſent, whatever it be, and believe that I am always ready to ſerve you in greater things.</p>

            <p>THE former Critick of Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Simon,</hi> one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Oratory, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, firſt in <hi>French,</hi> and then in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> having ſuffer'd the fate of all other Books (of this nature eſpecially,) and undergone the Cenſures of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Capacities of Readers; the Author hath ſince thought fit to take the work a ſecond time in hand, and having reviſed, and abridged it, he put it into the Latine Tongue, from whence we have made this Verſion, intending (as I believe) that fewer of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb facs="tcp:50875:6"/>and injudicious part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men ſhould hereafter buſy their heads about it: Adding to it an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> by way of anſwer to certain objections raiſed againſt it, by the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably, and famouſly Learned Dr. <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> in his late Tract, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>De Sybillinis Oraculis.</hi> As for the few paſſages that in the former Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were any way obnoxious to the cavils of ſome, they are here moſtly omitted: ſo that there is very little to be found that is like to prove offenſive to any ſort of men or perſuaſion in Religion, if but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Ingenuous. This great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Scholar is, (it muſt be confeſt) one who lives in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but it muſt be withal remembred, that ſo was the great <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> alſo, who nevertheleſs is highly valued by all ſorts of ſober Proteſtants, and equalled in a manner with the very
<pb facs="tcp:50875:6"/>prime, and beſt of their Authors, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his learned Commentaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Holy Scriptures were rendred into our own Tongue, and chain'd up to the Pillars of our Churches in the very heat of the Reformation. As to the Book it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ſhall not be ſo importune as to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal either the judgments or ſatisfaction of its Readers, but only adventure in the general to ſay thus much; that as it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours neither of the Raveries of the Bigot, nor of the inſolence of the Prophane, ſo in it the learned Man and Scholar will find what will content him, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man, when he ſees how many, and abſtruſe things muſt be firſt known before a man can arrive to a competent judgment of Scripture difficulties, will find great reaſon for modeſty &amp; humility, &amp; not over pragmatically to oppoſe his own private ſpirit to the wiſdom of his Directors. As for thoſe to whom either the Name, or
<pb facs="tcp:50875:7"/>Profeſſion of our Author may create an inſuperable Prejudice, let them but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the learned <hi>Prolegomena</hi> of Biſhop <hi>Walton,</hi> premis'd to his Poly-glot Bible, and they will find that that Learned, and Reverend Prelate was (I had almoſt ſaid) exactly, but I may ſafely ſay upon the main of the ſame ſentiments with our Author. For my own part I doubt not but that the Candour of his Spirit, the juſtneſs of his Judgment, and impartiality of his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, will unqueſtionably ſupport his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, with all the Ingenuous and Wiſe, and as for the reſt, their very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation would be a Calumny.

                     </head>
                     <p>THE whole Context of Sacred Scripture is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably known among the Chriſtians by the name of <hi>The Books,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>The Books</hi> ſo call'd for their Excellency above all others; and theſe <hi>Books</hi> contain both the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> however allow of no more than only the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Old Teſtament.</note> and thoſe only written in the <hi>Hebrew Language;</hi> for as for thoſe which the Church has receiv d from the <hi>Helleniſt Jews</hi> in the <hi>Greek Language,</hi> they deny them to be <hi>Canonical,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not admit them into their <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Whereas the Church inſpir'd with the Holy Ghoſt, admits them likewiſe to be of Divine Authority. As to which difference, they who among Chriſtians aſſume to themſelves the Name of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> rather chuſe to take the Synagogues part, than to joyn with either of the Churches, that is, the Eaſtern or Weſtern. And therefore the Chriſtians have only admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church thoſe Books of the Old Teſtament, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50875:10"/>they receiv'd from the Jews. As for the New Teſtament, Chriſt the firſt Author of it, committed nothing of it to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but his Diſciples after his Paſſion made publick thoſe Books which we call the Books of the New Teſtament.<note place="margin">The New Teſtament.</note> Now who were the real Authors of thoſe Books, ſome there are who very much doubt, as if the Goſpels of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were not aſſuredly theirs. For, ſay they, they would not then be entitl'd the Goſpels according to <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> but the Goſpels of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> had they been wrote by them; and thus we generally ſay, the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not according to <hi>Moſes.</hi> But the Titles of the Goſpels and other Books are plainly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. For that the Goſpel which <hi>Matthew</hi> publiſhed, was not <hi>Matthews,</hi> but <hi>Chriſts;</hi> and therefore it is rightly inſcrib'd, <hi>According to St. Matthew;</hi> that is to ſay, the Goſpel of Chriſt according to the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> upon which the Chriſtians ground their Faith.</p>

                        </note>But now to return to the Jews, with whom the Oracles of God were firſt entruſted, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks it, the Holy Bible among them is called by ſeveral Names. For ſometimes they call it <hi>Mickra,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The names of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews.</note> or <hi>Reading;</hi> in which ſenſe thoſe words of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> are to be taken, where he ſays, <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>And cauſed them to underſtand the Reading.</hi> For though it be true that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in that place diſcourſes particularly of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites reading the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet afterwards that name was not unfitly attributed by the Jews to all the reſt of the Books of Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they denote the Scripture by theſe words <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim ve Arbang,</hi> or <hi>Twenty four;</hi> under which name they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the number of the Books of Sacred Writ. To which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems to have alluded, where he ſays, <hi>Which are not of the Twenty four Antient,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Praelections <hi>upon</hi> Nehem. <hi>and</hi> Eſdr.</note> have not equal Authority with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Writ. Now what is to be underſtood by the Twenty four Antient, the ſame St. <hi>Jerom</hi> more manifeſtly declares in <hi>Prolog Galeat.</hi> Neither is there any thing to be more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found than this name of the Sacred Writings, which they generally affix to the beginning of their Manuſcript Bibles; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thereby the whole Context of the Old Teſtament: Although <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a notable Witneſs in this Argument, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Sacred Books allowed by his Nation to be no more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50875:10"/>than Twenty Two. Which ſeems to have been ſo concluded, to the end the number of the Books might be the more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and ſtedfaſtly retained in the memory, by the numbers of the Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, which are alſo twenty two. Nevertheleſs it is not a thing lookt upon by the Jews as much material whether they reckon twenty four, or twenty two Books, only they divide them after another manner. This was well known to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who informs us, that they who number'd twenty four Books of Holy Writ, ſeparated the Book of <hi>Ruth</hi> from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> from the Propheſie it ſelf; which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by the Jews in our time, who attribute theſe two Books to the number of the Sacred Writers, but not of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>But they who ſeem'd to have had the choiceſt Opinion of the Bible, were the Sect of the <hi>Carraitans</hi> among the Jews, who gave it the name of a <hi>Propheſie.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Epiſt. c. 1.19.</note> Under which name St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to comprehend it: and indeed it may be thought to have been the Antient and Genuine name of the Scripture, which was not underſtood by the more Modern Jews, who have invented many Subtilties concerning the Books which are inſcrib'd <hi>Hanbiim,</hi> or the Prophets; and I admire to find that ſome Chriſtians alſo liſten to theſe acute Doctors. The Antient Diviſion likewiſe of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings into the Law, the Prophets and <hi>Cetuvim, Writings,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vulgar expreſſion, <hi>Holy Writings,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Scripture.</note> is a thing which is well known to all people. Which Diviſion wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tormented the Brains of the Jews, who have been very laboriouſly inquiſitive about it, and what was eaſie before have ſtrangely perplexed with their Niceties. <hi>Iſaac Abravanel</hi> a moſt acute perſon, complains, that none of his Rabbies have come near the mark, unleſs one <hi>Ephodaeus.</hi> But as to what that Rabby at large diſcourſes concerning that matter, we thought fit to paſs over in ſilence, as having more of wit than ſolidity. Taking therefore our leaves of theſe lighter Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we may have ſome reaſon to believe that the name of the <hi>Prophets</hi> was given to the Books of <hi>Joſhua, Judges,</hi> and other Hiſtorians, which were written before the Jews were carried out of their Country into <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe at that time the Jews called them Prophets, who undertook to write the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50875:11"/>of the Age wherein they liv'd. Thus in the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> frequent mention is made of <hi>Gad, Nathan,</hi> and other Prophets, becauſe they carefully collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the publick Tranſactions of their own Time, and then with no leſs diligence tranſcrib'd them into the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter. Which is the meaning of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> where he affirms, that it was not for every one among the Jews, to write the Publick Annals, but only for the Prophets. This <hi>Theodoret</hi> more largely explains,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> adverſ. Apo. Theod. in Praefat. in lib Reg. Id. <hi>2</hi> Reg.</note> where he boldly aſſerts, That there were ſeveral Prophets among the Jews, of which every one wrote the Story of their own Times, and that the greateſt part of the Books by them written, are paſt recovery loſt. And therefore he affirms it to be paſt all doubt, that the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> were taken out of ſeveral Books of the Prophets. With <hi>Theodoret, Diodorus, Procopius,</hi> and others not a few, eminent for their Learning, agree. Which ſeems to be the True Reaſon, why the Books of Sacred Scripture, which were written after the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> before the Captivity were call'd by the name of the Prophets; but that after that time they were only known by the ſingle name of <hi>Cetuvim,</hi> or <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi> Not that thereby they depriv'd them of the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt; for the Jews no leſs than the Chriſtians, willingly admit their Divine Authority, but only content themſelves with the ſingle name of <hi>Cetuvim,</hi> or <hi>Writings,</hi> as we generally call the whole Scripture by the name of the Bible. To ſay truth, it is for men that have little to do, more accurately to enquire into theſe names, and to hunt theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, of which the Antient Hebrew Writers never ſo much as thought.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon the Chriſtians, who in the Infancy of the Church, borrowed the Books of the Old Teſtament out of the Synagogues of the <hi>Jewiſh Helleniſts,</hi> neither ſeparated the Book of <hi>Ruth</hi> from the <hi>Judges,</hi> nor the <hi>Lamentations</hi> from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> as the reſt of the Jews do, who refer thoſe little Treatiſes to the third Claſſis of Sacred Writings, which are called <hi>Cetuvim.</hi> Nor is it a little to be wondred at what cruel pains that moſt ſubtle Doctor <hi>Abravanel</hi> takes, where he very angrily enquires, for what reaſon it was, that the Book of <hi>Ruth</hi> was not joyn'd to the Hiſtory of the <hi>Judges,</hi> to which it ſeems to belong more eſpecially, acknowledging <hi>Samuel</hi> to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50875:11"/>be the Author of both. But the Chriſtians, according to the Example of the Helleniſt Jews, have reduc'd the Books of Sacred Scripture into much better order, which ſeems to be the firſt order and diſpoſition of the Holy Writings, which was allowed by the Antient Jews, and approved by the publick uſe of the Synagogues. Therefore the Jews commit a great folly, who as well in their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, as in their Printed Copies, ſeparate the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> from the body of the reſt; as if the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, which was preſent with <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, were not the ſame in all, as that wherewith the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets were inſpired. The ſame abſurdities they run into concerning <hi>David,</hi> whom they refuſe to number in the Liſt of the Prophets, though they confeſs him to have uttered many Prophecies. So true it is, that thoſe Rabbies, who ſo highly value their Paternal Traditions, invented many things unknown to their Fore-Fathers, and which it ſeems much more rational to take out of the Books of the Chriſtians, than the Works, eſpecially of the more Modern Jews. For the former imitated the Antient Cuſtom of the Synagogues, which does not ſeem to have deſcended entire to the Jews of later Ages. And therefore that Order of the Books of Sacred Scripture is to be retain'd, which is obſerved in the Greek and Latine Bibles of the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Neither are we to liſten to thoſe, who following the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Jewiſh Rabbies, pervert that Antient Order in the Greek and Latine Copies of the Bible which they put forth. And yet I do not believe that Order to be ſo exactly neceſſary in ſmaller Editions, in regard that as to thoſe things, neither the Jews agree among themſelves, nor the Chriſtians neither <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> divides his Work of <hi>Divine Readings</hi> into theſe three Heads; <hi>The Diviſion of Scripture according to St.</hi> Jerom; <hi>The Diviſion of Scripture according to St.</hi> Auſtin; <hi>The Diviſion of Scripture according to the Septuagint.</hi> The Jews alſo, though moſt paſſionately devoted to their own Traditions, and wholly govern'd by the Talmudick Rabbies, obſerve, in the Diſpoſal of the Books of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> another Method than that which is approved by the Talmudiſts. Alſo the very Order of their Manuſcript Copies varies in that particular.</p>

                     <p>WE may divide the Hebrew Manuſcripts of the Jews into two ſorts, of which the one ſerves for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick uſe of the Synagogues, the other for the particular uſe of private perſons. Neither do they read in their Synagogues every particular Book of Holy Writ, but only ſuch and ſuch ſelected Books,<note place="margin">The Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture read in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</note> which are adapted and accommodated to the Myſteries of their Religion, ſuch as are the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> from whence they derive the Precepts of their Law, and thoſe which they comprehend under the name of the five <hi>Megilloth</hi> or <hi>Volumes.</hi> That is to ſay, the <hi>Canticles, Ruth,</hi> the <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Eccleſiaſtes</hi> and <hi>Eſther.</hi> For theſe are the Volumes that are read in their Synagogues upon certain prefix'd days; the <hi>Canticles</hi> upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, <hi>Ruth</hi> upon the Feaſt of Seven days, the <hi>Lamentations</hi> upon the ninth of the Month <hi>Ab. Eccleſiaſtes</hi> upon the Feaſt of the Tabernacles, and <hi>Eſther</hi> upon the 14th and 15th of the Month <hi>Adar.</hi> And as for the Law, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſo many Sections as there are Sabbaths in the year; ſo that they read a Section every year, with an addition of ſomething taken out of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of the Jews in writing their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Books.</note>'Tis a wonderful thing to ſee how ridiculouſly devout, and idly ſuperſtitious the Jews are in writing out the Copies which are for the uſe of the Synagogue. For in the firſt place, not content with the bare and naked Letter according as is to be ſeen in other Printed and Written Copies, they adorn the ſeveral Letters with little Coronets which they call <hi>Tagin.</hi> Neither are they aſham'd to make God the Author of thoſe flouriſhes, which they ſay, <hi>Moſes</hi> learnt of God in Mount <hi>Sinai. R. Moſes Scem Tob</hi> in his Book, where after the manner of the Cabbaliſts, he ſeeks for the Reaſon of the Letters of the Alphabet; tells ye many ſtories concerning thoſe Coronets, complaining that they were known to few of the Jews. <hi>Thou ſhalt underſtand and hear,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Diſcourſe which was drawn by our Anceſtors of bleſſed memory, in the Treatiſe</hi> Hagiga, <hi>and ſhalt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50875:12"/>make</hi> Aleph, <hi>wherein are ſeven Coronets: There are ſeven alſo of the ſame nature in the Law;</hi> Beth, <hi>wherein are three Coronets, they are four in the Law;</hi> Gimel, <hi>which has four flouriſhes, three in the Law;</hi> Daleth, <hi>which has four flouriſhes, ſix in the Law.</hi> After the ſame manner does the ſame Rabby run over all the reſt of the Letters; he alſo has been ſo punctual to give us a Copy of the following Flouriſhes, with Inſtruction how to make them, and how often they are to be met with in the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> He alſo obſerv'd their differences; ſome of theſe Flouriſhes being fix'd cloſe to the Letter; others ſet a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Letter, either over the Letter, or underneath it. But theſe were only the Dreams &amp; Fancies of Jewiſh <hi>Brains,</hi> about which nevertheleſs thoſe Rabbies trifle away their time very ſeriouſly. Thus <hi>Bal Maſius</hi> makes Coronets for the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Zain</hi> and <hi>Heth,</hi> quite different from thoſe which <hi>R. Scem Tob</hi> delineates from the Tradition of his Fathers. Farther, theſe Jewiſh Rabbies ſhew an extream Superſtition and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the choice of their Parchment; for Paper they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject as a new Invention. This Parchment muſt be very clean; nor can it be prepar'd by an Infidel or Ethnick, but by a Jew, and he neither an Apoſtate or a Heretick. Therefore the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Copies are altogether renounc'd by the Jews, as vile and impure. Moreover, they do not write as we do in folded Sheets, but in large Volumes, after the Cuſtom of the Antients, which they divide into Columes or Pages, obſerving as it were a Geometrical Proportion, and making uſe of a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to draw the Lines ſtreight; for they have the vanity to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>Moſes</hi> order'd that no Copy of the Law ſhould be written without a Ruler; and they alſo pretend that <hi>Moſes</hi> taught them what ſort of Ink they ſhould uſe. In writing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the firſt place, not to joyn their Letters cloſe together; obſerving this proportion between the Letters and the Words, to leave the ſpace of a Silk Thred between every Letter, and of a ſmall Letter between every Word; that the Lines be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one from another the meaſure of one Line, and every Line to hold thirty Letters. To theſe may be added the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of the Sections; of which ſome are larger, and ſome leſſer: And then again ſome of theſe Sections are ſaid to be cloſe, others open. Thoſe are call'd cloſe, which are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd on both ſides with Letters, that the ſpace of four Letters
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50875:13"/>be only left, in open Sections the ſpace of nine Letters. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there are alſo other larger Sections, which are alſo to be ſeen in the publick Exemplars of their Bibles. But thoſe Jewiſh Rabbies are mainly deceiv'd, who believe that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Inventer of thoſe Diviſions or Sections, which are made in the Modern Copies. For thoſe Diſtinctions were found out by the late ſort of Criticks,<note place="margin">The Antient Form of the Bibles.</note> eſpecially thoſe who call themſelves <hi>Moſorethae;</hi> for that in the Antient times there were no mark of Diſtinctions to be found either in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, or Latine Copies: For that was the buſineſs of the Grammarians; and as <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite rightly obſerves, the whole Law was antiently <hi>Paſuck Echad,</hi> without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Letters or Words; which as the Learned know was alſo obſerv'd by the Grecian Criticks, in reference to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> works.

Then he read another Verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor could the Interpreter proceed till the Reader was got to the end of a Verſe; nor could the Reader read another Verſe, till the Interpreter had made an end of his Interpretation.</hi> Whence it may be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Exemplars of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law were diſtinguiſhed into Verſes before the Talmudiſts were in Being.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe things might well enough be obſerv'd as well by the Reader, as by the Expoſitor, from the times of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> without any note of Diſtinction between the Context of the Verſes, which the Antient Tranſlations of the Bibles, which were publiſh'd in Greek before St. <hi>Jerom</hi> liv'd, apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf, who frequently diſtinguiſhes thoſe Verſes after another manner from that which is now made uſe of, in the Maſoretick Editions generally publiſhed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50875:13"/>in theſe days. But this ſeems chiefly moſt worthy obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to our preſent buſineſs, that there appears nothing at all of the Points of Vowels, which as it were, confine the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Reading of the Hebrew Context within certain bounds, nor in like manner, any thing of thoſe Accents which are now in the room of Points, Titles, and other late invented ſtrokes of the Pen. Then again, that there was formerly no diviſion of Sections in the Manuſcript Copies, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars ſufficiently teſtifie, wherein ſuch kind of Sections are mark'd after a diſtinct manner: Which had they been added to the Law by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, as the Jewiſh Rabbies falſly imagine, there would follow the greateſt conſent that could be, as to this matter, between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Falſly therefore the Talmudiſts pronounce, that no Verſe ought to be diſtinguiſh'd that was not diſtinguiſh'd by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For if it were ſo, why do the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> differ in this particular from the <hi>Maſorethites,</hi> who are ſaid to have put a hedge about the Law, <hi>Sig Le Torah?</hi> Was it impoſſible that the Jews, ſuch reſolute obſervers of their own Traditions, ſhould not be able to retain the ſame Tradition receiv'd from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to preſerve it entire in their ſeveral Copies?<note place="margin">R. Moſes.</note> Nor is there any other judgment to be made concerning the Diviſions of the Sections, whenas the ſame <hi>Maſorethites,</hi> as <hi>R. Moſes</hi> atteſts, by reaſon of the difference of the Copies to which they truſted, could not agree among themſelves; and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that he found a very great Confuſion in all the Copies that came to his hands; inſomuch that rejecting all the other Exemplars, he ſtuck only to one which was thought to have been corrected by <hi>R. Aſcer,</hi> and followed it in every thing for the making out a Copy for his own uſe.</p>
                     <p>As for the Time when theſe Marks of Sections, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's, and other Diſtinctions firſt crept into the Context of the Bible, it will be needleſs to make any over-curious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. For theſe things being only the Fancies of Criticks, will obtain no greater Authority than what it can win from the conſent and publick practice of the Rabbies; for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variation of Times, and ſucceſſion of Ages, they were ſubject to various Alterations, as being things that depended meerly upon the Judgments and Conceits of men. One of the great Criticks among the Jews, <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50875:14"/>all theſe things had their birth in the School Rabbies of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias,</hi> vulgarly call'd the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> after the Deceaſe of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and the Talmudiſts: ſo that whatever was publiſh'd afterward concerning the Antiquity of thoſe Diſtinctions, were but the fancies and conceits of idle people, as if any other Opinion were to be conceiv'd in this particular of the Holy Writings, than of the Greek and Latine Books. For it was not neceſſary that Books, becauſe they are holy, ſhould not be permitted to come into the World without their Points and Interpunctions: as if, for Example, the pointing of the Modern Latine Verſion, which the Holy See has approv'd by her conſent, and has thought only fit to be retain'd in all the Latine Editions of the Bible, were neceſſarily to be derived from the Times of the Apoſtles. But we have ſaid enough upon this Subject; now to the Copies in uſe among private perſons.</p>
                     <p>Theſe alſo may be ſaid to be of two ſorts; of which ſome were written out by the Vulgar Jews, and ſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people; others by men that were skilful in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and for the uſe of thoſe who were eminent in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſuch as were thoſe who took upon them the Title of <hi>Naſſi,</hi> or Prince. The firſt being written in a leſſer Character and Bulk, and not ſo carefully corrected as they ought to have been, are found to be full of Errours. And ſeveral ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies as theſe are found in ſeveral Libraries of the Chriſtians. But the latter being done with great labour and coſt, and from Copies the moſt Antient and beſt corrected, are far to be preferred before all others. They are written in large and moſt elegant Capital Letters, and which is a certain ſign of a good Copy, none of thoſe words appear to be omitted in theſe, which are added down in leſſer Characters upon the Margin of the Leaf, as in the Books of the common Jews, which abound with thoſe kind of faults. For they being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the ſimilitude of words and ſentences following one another, ſet down the maim'd and curtail'd words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, hardly minding what they write.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it is of great conſequence from whence, and from what hands theſe Manuſcript Copies are taken.<note place="margin">More cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Bibles.</note> For the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> are much better corrected than the <hi>German, French,</hi> or <hi>Italian.</hi> For the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jews have been much more careful to correct

Which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite, not a little practis'd in this ſort of Study, after a recital of ſeveral Copies of Bibles, adds this concerning the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Exemplars, <hi>The Book</hi> Aſpamia,<note place="margin">Elias.

                     <p>We have ſome reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>Hillel</hi> to be a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Nation, and a famous Rector of ſome Academy, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Maſoretick Edition in ſundry places according to the Antient Copies.

And hither ought we to refer the Animadverſions of R. <hi>R. Judas, Jonas, Kimchi,</hi> and others, who have oft recourſe to the <hi>Sepharim Midvikim,</hi> or corrected Copies; and hither alſo belongs that note frequent in the Margin, moſt eſpecially of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manuſcripts, <hi>B' Sepher Achar, in the other Copy.</hi> But that <hi>Hillel</hi> was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> is not only to be proved from hence, that his Biblick Copy was found in <hi>Spain,</hi> and firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jews; but becauſe I find ſeveral of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lections quoted in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Exemplars, quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in the <hi>German</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>In like manner we may affirm, that the Exemplars of the Bibles, which the Jews extol under the names of <hi>Ben Aſcer,</hi> and <hi>Ben Narthali,</hi> were written out by ſuch perſons, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preſidents of Publick Academys, made it their buſineſs to reform Erroneous Copies. But in what time they liv'd, is a thing not well known to the Jews themſelves, very little cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of their own Chronology. However common fame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50875:17"/>them to have liv'd about the year 1034. long after the <hi>Tyberian</hi> Maſorites.<note place="margin">R. <hi>Moſes Tephil.</hi> c. 8.</note> And this was the Opinion of R. <hi>Gedalia,</hi> R. <hi>David Gans,</hi> and ſeveral others among the Chriſtians. It cannot be unknown what R. <hi>Moſes</hi> has written concerning <hi>Ben Aſcer</hi>'s Manuſcript, which, as he aſſerts, was very well known in <hi>Egypt,</hi> by which the <hi>Hieroſolymitan</hi> Jews corrected their own Books. <hi>That is the Examplar,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which they all uſe, becauſe</hi> Ben Aſcer <hi>corrected it;</hi> labouring at it for many years, and correcting it many times quite thorough. For the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours or Preſidents of the Academies, formerly according to the Cuſtom of the Jews, wrote out Copies, which afterwards were made uſe of by the Provinces, of which they were Chief Rulers and Princes; eſpecially if they were in any eſteem for being Learned; whence ſeems to have riſen that variety of Readings which is found among the Manuſcript Copies of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces, and diſtinct Ages. Nor do the Rabbies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeem to deny it, who believe that the Weſtern Jews follow'd R. <hi>Aſcer;</hi> and the Oriental R. <hi>Naphtali</hi> in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of their Copies. Now, they call the Weſtern Jews thoſe that dwell in and about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Eaſtern Jews thoſe that live in and about <hi>Babylon.</hi> The <hi>Hieroſolymitan</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, ſaith <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>is that which Rabbi</hi> Jonas <hi>the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian found, by the Teſtimony of R.</hi> David Kimchi, <hi>and perhaps may be that Exemplar which R.</hi> Aſcer <hi>corrected, who liv'd a long time at</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
                     <p>But the Lections, about which the Rabbies themſelves are at variance, are very ſlight and trivial, as they are in the <hi>Hille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian:</hi> Nor will it be worth while to repeat them here, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there is a Catalogue of them annexed to the large <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles. Let it ſuffice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Catalogue of the ſame Varieties in Manuſcript which are fixed at the end of ſome Manuſcript Bibles, and to which they might have recourſe, do not exactly agree with thoſe that are Printed at <hi>London, Baſil</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> For ſome, which in the Vulgar Editions claim <hi>Ben Aſcer</hi> for their Author, belong to thoſe Catalogues, which indeed owe their publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to R. <hi>Naphtali.</hi> Such is that which is reckon'd the ſixth in number, and thoſe which follow. Thoſe Manuſcript Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues alſo add ſome, and other Variations they omit, beſides thoſe already Printed. For where the Modern Lection makes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50875:17"/>uſe of the Accent <hi>Maccaph,</hi> the more recent Manuſcripts make uſe of the Point <hi>Dageſh,</hi> or of ſome ſuch thing. Nor could there be any other way to knit together the ſeries of thoſe ſlight niceties, becauſe they are of little or no uſe. For ſhould we obſerve all the Variances of this kind, which might be found in turning over thoſe Manuſcripts, with an intention to embody them in one heap; ſuch a Collection would certainly ſwell into a large Volume. For I muſt needs ſay, they had leiſure to ſpare, who lookt after the Edition of the Engliſh Polyglottons, who have not only publiſh'd thoſe Lections eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in their order, as they found them in the <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Editions, but have alſo added the ſeveral places of Scripture, of which there was hither never any Index before. So that I wonder that men otherwiſe Learned, ſhould have no better thought than to employ themſelves about ſuch trifles: But as to thoſe differences of Readings, which before the Times of the <hi>Tiberian</hi> Rabbies commaculated the holy Text, and are of greater moment, ſhould be ſo ſluggiſhly careleſs: And, which is worſe, having little knowledge of the Books of the Ancient Writers, but only accuſtom'd to the Varieties in thoſe Manuſcripts of later date already mention'd; yet they affirm a wonderful agreement of the Hebrew Copies among themſelves. Here might be added alſo thoſe Varieties which are, <hi>Ben Magnarabei ou Madnachei, between the Eaſtern and Weſtern Jews:</hi> But in regard they are already publick, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few that are of moment, that I may not ſeem to be an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifier of Scripture-Variances, I ſhall forbear to repeat them, eſpecially they being publiſh'd at the end of the <hi>Baſil</hi> Bibles. However, from hence we may collect, that the Hebrew Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars do not ſo eaſily agree among themſelves, that there ſhould be no variance, as moſt of the Jews, and the Chriſtians their Hebrew followers, would make us believe; whenas ſome of thoſe Lections, though not ſo many,<note place="margin">Various Lections among the Rabbins.</note> produce a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Now let us come to the Teſtimonies of the Rabbies, which confirm the ſame Opinion concerning the Diſcrepancy of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Copies.<note place="margin">R. Jacob Haim Praef. in Maſ. Mag. Buxtorf. in Antior.</note> There are not wanting Examples of various Readings among the Talmudick Doctors, drawn from the publiſh'd or Maſoretick Tranſcriptions. Of which ſome are cited by R. <hi>Jacob Haim,</hi> which <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> a ſtrenuous Champion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50875:18"/>for the Maſoretick Exemplar, though unwillingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; nor will he have to be other than a very few, and thoſe of no great weight, not contradictory to the truth of Senſe; and yet they ſpend the greateſt part of their time in writing out the words either fully, or defectively, as they term it. However, among thoſe few which R. <hi>Jacob Haim</hi> brings by way of Example, it may be plainly demonſtrated, that there are ſome which alter the ſenſe of Scripture. But I may ſay, that we ſhould in vain go about to find out thoſe various Lections in the Talmudick Work now extant, which formerly might more eaſily be gathered from it. For that for many Ages together, the Jews have made it their buſineſs to reform all their Bibles, both Printed and Manuſcript, by the Maſoreticks, as in the Reading thoſe Books I have often obſerv'd. However, care muſt be that you do not miſtake that form of ſpeech frequently made uſe of in the Talmud, <hi>Read not ſo, but ſo,</hi> for a various Lection. For it is a kind of Allegorical ſport, very familiar with thoſe Rabbies, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to themſelves the ſubſtance, as I may ſo ſay of the word, have childiſhly invented ſeveral ways of Reading one and the ſame word. If any one has ſo much leiſure to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon thoſe places of Scripture, which are extant in the Talmudick Work, there is no neceſſity for him to turn over thoſe immenſe Volumes, ſo inacceſſible to many men; for we have a Table which is entitled, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, wherein all the places of Scripture which are extoll'd in the Talmud, are digeſted in their order, with the place and the page where they may be found in the Talmud. But what profit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage a man ſhall reap from ſuch a tedious piece of labour, I cannot apprehend, unleſs we could have recourſe to the moſt Antient Copies of the Talmud, which have eſcap'd the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure hands of the Jewiſh Criticaſters.</p>
                     <p>Far more Varieties of this nature are found in the Books of the more Modern Jews, although they pretend themſelves moſt ſtout Aſſerters of the Maſoretick Reading. Thus R. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Kimchi,</hi> does not ſo devoutly adhere to the Maſoretick Copies, but that he ſometimes forſakes them; and therefore upon thoſe words of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Prophet <hi>Le Mickdaſh Megnat,</hi> he makes this obſervation,<note place="margin">R. <hi>Kimchi</hi> Comment. in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the word</hi> Mickdaſh <hi>is a word mark'd with a</hi> Pathack <hi>underneath the</hi> Daleth: <hi>Neither is</hi> Megnat <hi>a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50875:18"/>Noun Adjective, but a Subſtantive, as I have found in ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Copies; in others I have met with</hi> Camots, <hi>and ſo it may be an Adjective.</hi> Where we read in our Modern Copies the Earth was fill'd with blood <hi>Damim, Kimchi</hi> reads it in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Chamas,</hi> or <hi>Violence;</hi> yet he obſerves the other Lection to be extant in ſome other Verſions. Concerning the word <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavis,</hi> in the 12th <hi>chap.</hi> of the ſame <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> he thus diſcourſes; <hi>The ſtones</hi> Elgavis, <hi>are ſtones like hail-ſtones; for in ſome corrected Editions the word</hi> El <hi>and</hi> Gavis <hi>are divided, in others it is all one.</hi> But I make too long a ſtay upon theſe things, when there is nothing more frequent in that Rabbies Dictionary, and his Comment upon the Scripture, than ſuch kind of Expreſſions, <hi>in the corrected Book; in ſome corrected Books,</hi> and the like. For, more frequent are thoſe which you meet with in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of R. <hi>Aben Melech,</hi> who acknowledges that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd his Treatiſe out of the Works R. <hi>R. Judas, Jonas Aben Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Kimchi,</hi> and other Grammarians. He in the 24th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> upon the word <hi>Harkach, which in the Maſoretick Editions</hi> is read with the Vowel <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thack</hi> under the Letter <hi>He;</hi> Harkach <hi>is the Infinitive or Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the Conjugation</hi> Hiphil.

                     </p>
                     <p>From this variety of Reading may thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> be illuſtrated, <hi>Haſhmen Leb Hagnam Hazzeh,</hi> which the LXX. Interpreters have tranſlated one way, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> another. For they reading the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <note place="margin">Hier. ad c. <hi>6. Iſa.</hi>
                        </note> and with much anxiety demands why St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the New Teſtament <hi>ſpake not according to the Hebrew, which he knew to be true, but according to the Septuagint.</hi> Wherein he ſhews himſelf a more tenacious obſerver of the Reading which he had been taught by his Maſters. For the various Interpretations of that place
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50875:19"/>might have been eaſily reconcil'd, and in the ſame manner as <hi>Kimchi</hi> and other Rabbies have referr'd the various Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word <hi>Harkach</hi> to the difference of Reading. For the LXX Interpreters read the word <hi>Hoſhman</hi> in <hi>Hophal,</hi> whereas St. <hi>Jerom</hi> read it <hi>Haſhmen</hi> in the Imperative of the Conjugation <hi>Hiphil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I might here add ſeveral other paſſages out of the Works of the <hi>Eben Eſra,</hi> ſirnamed by the Jews, <hi>the Wiſe;</hi> who as he was a very skilful Critick, ſo would he not altogether depend upon the Copies and Readings of the <hi>Maſorites;</hi> but he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minds the ſenſe, than the Letters of his Copy. For which reaſon, to omit all others, he believes that the Letters <hi>Aleph, Vau, Jod,</hi> which are vulgarly call'd the Mothers of Reading, were added or neglected by the Tranſcribers at their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.<note place="margin">Aben Eſr. Praefat.

But that moſt Learned Rabbi did not deem himſelf ſo religiouſly bound to follow the Decrees of the Maſorites and their Exemplars, that he thought it a crime to depart from them. Therefore at the end of his Book <hi>Jeſed Mora</hi> he thus writes;<note place="margin">Id. in lib. Jeſed Mora.</note>

Wherefore in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings he does not ſo much regard the manner, as the reaſon of the Tranſcription. Thus in his Commentary upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. he believes the word <hi>Naſah</hi> written with a <hi>Samech</hi> and <hi>He,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, There ſeem not to have been wanting among the Jews certain Criticks, who have employ'd all their time in noting the Readings of the various Copies. Of whom the principal are Rabbi <hi>Menahem de Lonzano</hi> in a Treatiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Schethe Jadoth,</hi> and the Author of a certain other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe entitled <hi>Minchath Cohen.</hi> He divides his whole work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts; and every part or hand contains five fingers, of which the firſt illuſtrates all the various Lections which he could find in the ſeveral Manuſcripts of the Moſaical Law, by the help of ten written Copies; which he thinks to have been written within this five or ſix hundred years; and he compares them with the ſecond Edition of <hi>Bomberg</hi> in <hi>Folio,</hi> which is the moſt accurate of all; he alſo ſtrictly examines the Words, the Letters, Points and Accents of this Edition. But all this indefatigable labour and diligence of R. <hi>Menahem,</hi> tends no farther than to demonſtrate, that the various Readings of Scripture, which are found in the ſeveral Copies of the Bibles, ought to be tryed by the <hi>Maſora,</hi> as the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule of Reaſon and Writing. Of the ſame Opinion is the Author of the Little Treatiſe called <hi>Minchath Cohen,</hi> who there moſt acutely diſcourſes of what words are to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fully, and which defectively: And ſtudies to reduce ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lections to their natural exactneſs by the help of the <hi>Maſora,</hi> and the corrected Books. Of neceſſity therefore thoſe Maſoretick Copies are to be examined, whoſe ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſo highly applauded by the Jews; whether they are ſo pure and correct, that it may be thought a point of Faith to ſwerve from them.</p>

For the Jews for many Ages together have acknowledged no other, and from them they came into the hands of the Chriſtians. Whence aroſe that general Agreement between ſo many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of ſeveral Places and Times; excepting thoſe few and trivial Niceties, which are rather the ſlips of negligent Tranſcribers, than various Lections. For how could it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, whenas the Jews, who look upon the <hi>Maſora</hi> to be as it were deſcended from Heaven, ſcruple not to make that their Rule for the Reformation of all Bibles, raſing out of all other Manuſcript Copies, Letters, Words, and whole Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, to make them conformable to the <hi>Maſora?</hi> And this is eaſie to be obſerv'd by thoſe that run over all the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Copies that have been written for theſe four or five hundred years laſt paſt; and hence it is that there is ſuch a wonderful concurrence among the Printed Bibles. To which, while not only the Jews, but alſo the moſt Learned among the Jews, do not give a ſufficient reſpect, admiring over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much the Exactneſs of the Hebrew Copy, they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Promoters of the latter, with a more than needful Zeal. Therefore <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> boldly affirms, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Context has been preſerv'd with ſo much care by the help of the Maſora, that it never could be diſcern'd by the moſt diligent and piercing Wit or Judgment to have admitted the leaſt variance in ſeveral Exemplars. In like manner. <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf,</hi> a perſon that had very much, and long turmoil'd in theſe ſtudies, extols the Maſora even to exceſs in theſe words, as if it had been ſent from Heaven. <hi>Herein as far as the Eaſt and Weſt extend, the Word of God is to be read in one Language, and after one manner.

                     </p>
                     <p>However, this egregious Applauder of the Maſorites ſpeaks rather out of a preconceiv'd Opinion of the Jews, than accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the verity of the Thing. He has ſeem'd to tranſlate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Commentary upon the Maſoreth, all the Fables of thoſe his Maſters, to whom he wholly dedicated himſelf. And by that means he has drawn in moſt of the Proteſtant Divines, eſpecially the Northern, to his own, or rather the Jews Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Exactneſs of the Hebrew Context, being as it were overwhelmed under the Teſtimonies of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins. They who have been converſant among the Monuments of the Antients, eſpecially in the Commentaries of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and are therefore better experienc'd in Critick Learning, think far otherwiſe of that Work: Nor do they preſently ſwallow thoſe things for Truth, with which the Jews, half aſleep, are illiterately contented. Rather <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite is to be liſtened to in this particular, who alone among the Jews, apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſtudy of the <hi>Maſora,</hi> then to the Rout of the Jews, who were altogether ignorant of it.

R.</hi> Aben Ezra <hi>alſo writes, that from them the Authors of the</hi> Maſora, <hi>point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accenting, took their Original, contrary to the common Sentiments of our Fathers of bleſſed memory, who affirm that</hi> Ezra <hi>the Scribe was the firſt that order'd and appointed thoſe Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Thus what <hi>Elias</hi> reports concerning the Learning and Skill of the Jews of <hi>Tyberias</hi> in the Hebrew Language, agrees with what has been written by <hi>Origen, Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> upon the ſame Subject. He teſtifies that he ſent for an Hebrew Maſter from the School at <hi>Tyberias,</hi> who aſſiſted him in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Chronicles</hi> out of the Hebrew into Latine. Toward the end of the fifth Action of the 2d Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> mention is made of a certain Jew of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> who in the Reign of <hi>Leo Iſauricus,</hi> was the Author of the Decree againſt the Images of the Chriſtians. Whence it is apparent, that the Jewiſh School at <hi>Tyberias,</hi> to whom the Maſoretick Work, or the Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50875:21"/>of the Biblick Exemplar now in uſe among the Jews and Chriſtians is attributed, was the moſt famous in the time of our Fore-fathers, and was in great Authority, eſpecially among the Jews. Whence it came to paſs, that their Critical Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions upon ſeveral Exemplars of the Bibles then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly diſperſed, were the more readily receiv'd by the reſt of the Jewiſh Nation.</p>
                     <p>They are Trifles therefore, and the Delirium's of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Jews, which the moſt of them, and by their ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many of the Chriſtians vainly chatter concerning the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Antiquity of their <hi>Maſora;</hi> as if <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had been partly the Author of it, and partly <hi>Eſdras,</hi> with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of the Sanedrim. For the thing it ſelf demonſtrates that the <hi>Maſora</hi> was invented long after the LXX Interpreters, and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who made uſe of Rabbies of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes mention of the <hi>Maſora.</hi> There were indeed among the Jews, as among other all other People, perſons addicted to Criticiſm, who had reform'd their Language, and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Works, by the help of Critical Learning, and the aſſiſtance of Manuſcript Copies. And the Variations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which thoſe Criticks obſerve, and which they place in the Margin of the Hebrew Context, manifeſtly prove that ſeveral Exemplars of Manuſcript Bibles were by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view'd and corrected. But what Divinity or Inſpiration could be aſſerted from hence? What was not perform'd with much more ſucceſs in the Greek and Latine Copies? But the Jews, who were born rather to Superſtition than Religion, being altogether ignorant of the Critical Science, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought to a greater perfection by the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, feigned a thouſand monſtrous Opinions, which ſome of the Chriſtians afterwards too greedily embrac'd. <hi>Elias</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, who had frequented the company of Learned Men at <hi>Rome, Venice,</hi> and other parts of the World, neglecting the Traditions of his Fathers, rightly obſerves that there is no other Judgment to be given of the Jewiſh Bibles, than of the Greek and Latine; and for Adherers to his Opinion, among the Chriſtians, he had all thoſe who had any knowledge of the Greek, Latine, or Critical Learning. Yet I think the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of <hi>Cappellus,</hi> and <hi>John Morinus,</hi> are to be cautiouſly read, who ſhewing themſelves ſomewhat ſo eagerly incenſed againſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50875:21"/>the Jews and Hebraiſts in the heat of Diſputation, do not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend what is profitable, and what of no uſe in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora;</hi> as if it were therefore wholly to be rejected, becauſe it was firſt communicated to us by the Jews. Rather it ought to be receiv'd by us for that very reaſon, as being deriv'd to us from perſons skilful in the Language, and vers'd in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts. For from whence could the Tradition of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Pronunciation be better communicated to us, than from thoſe who had retain'd it in their Synagogues and Schools. However, we are not to adhere to the Decrees of that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being humane, and ſubject to Errour; though the ſeveral Emendations may be admitted, as being the Labour of the Doctors of a moſt famous Academy.</p>
                     <p>The number of the Maſorites is hardly to be reckon'd up, as <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite affirms; and to uſe his own words, <hi>Hundreds and Thouſands there were ſucceeding one another for many years; nor is the time certain when they began, nor when they compleated their work;</hi> that is, the prefixed time. For he conſtantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that it was ſince the Talmud, and he refers the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it to the year of Chriſt 506. So that I believe it might have its firſt beginning about the year 600. at what time the <hi>Arabians</hi> took it into their hands, to whom the Jews are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for all that they have of Grammar and Criticks. They have a Maſora belonging to their Alcoran, not much unlike that of the Jews: The Letters, Words and Verſes of that Book being numbred, which they ſeem to have borrowed from the Greek and Latine Bibles, which they tranſlated into their own Language. At firſt I am apt to think that the Maſora was tranſcrib'd apart into particular Books, by the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> for exerciſe of their Scholars within the walls of the School. For that they durſt not preſume to introduce their Vowel Points, and other marks of Maſoretick Ingenuity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hebrew Text, is ſomething probable from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the pointed Vowels, Accents, and the like, were not in our time to be ſeen in the Manuſcripts which were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly us'd in the Synagogues. And the moſt approv'd Copies of Manuſcripts for the uſe of private perſons, wanted thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, as I have obſerv'd by their reading; but were added afterwards by the Jewiſh Criticaſters. But then the Tranſcribers, underſtanding the benefit of Points and Accents
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50875:22"/>for the reading and diſtinction of the Hebrew Context, made no ſcruple to inſert thoſe New Additions. Thus by degrees from thoſe Maſoretick Notes, which nevertheleſs were grown to an immenſe bulk, the more choice, or at leaſt thoſe which were contain'd in the diſtinct Copies of the Maſora, were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the benefit of thoſe Copies which they had daily occaſion to tranſcribe, as may be ſeen in moſt of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Copies of the Jewiſh Bibles; but chiefly in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Bibles of the ſecond and third Edition, which being collected from ſundry Books, were firſt publiſhed by R. <hi>Jacob Ben Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jim,</hi> who reduc'd the ſcatter'd parts of the Maſora into the Form which now they obſerve. From whence it was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, and added to thoſe Bibles which <hi>Buxtorf</hi> procur'd to be Printed at <hi>Baſil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now from what has been ſaid, who can believe that the Jews could ever be able, by the help of their Maſora, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Bibles from all manner of Errours, when thoſe Criticks, who lent their healing hands to the Copies of their Times, were neither Prophets, nor inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, but only men, who being the Governours of a moſt famous Academy, review'd the whole Context of Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſought as far as in them lay, to bring it to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with its moſt Antient and uncorrupted Exemplars, as the Doctors of <hi>Lovain</hi> undertook St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Works. So that we may rightly compare the Maſoretick Labour to the Toil of <hi>Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> about the Latine Interpreter. For he, ſo ſoon as the Latine Edition by the command of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. was compar'd with the moſt Antient &amp; beſt Eſteem'd Tranſlations, and thereby refin'd from its Errours, Bibles ſhould be afterwards Printed with their Errours. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, no man of Judgment will ſay, that that ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Verſion is free from all miſtake, when <hi>Baronius, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> and others, ſome of whom aſſiſted at this Correction, make no diſpute that many Errours remain very neceſſary to be amended. Some of the Jewiſh Rabbies indeed there are, who highly commend the Diligence and Induſtry of the Maſorites, for that with ſo much Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry they took an account of the Letters, Words, and Verſes of the Hebrew Context, to prevent the future depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50875:22"/>of Holy Writ. But who can thence think it poſſible to be prov'd, that the Sacred Books were thereby reſtor'd to to their Antient Form? True it is, that the Doctors of <hi>Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> might number the Letters, Words and Verſes of the Books extant in their Time: However, thoſe Books were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Copies, and not Originals. I will alſo grant that they were moſt perfect in the Hebrew Language, and that they made uſe of the moſt corrected Exemplars of the Bible, which by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch they could find out for the carrying on their Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Deſign: But yet their Materials were ſtill deficient, when they could have no recourſe either to the Greek Interpreters, nor to the Latine Verſion, who in their Tranſlations made uſe of Copies differing from the Maſoretick. Then again Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion combates for the friends of the Maſorites, which the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word inſinuates, as if by the aſſiſtance of Points and other Characters, they had render'd the Reading and Pronunciation of the Hebrew Context receiv'd into uſe for many Ages certain and indubitable. The Sect of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeans</hi> alſo became ſtrenuous Champions for the Maſora of the Jews, and the Exemplars ſet forth, who though they reject the moſt of the Jewiſh Traditions as old Womens Fables, yet admit of the Biblick Context in the ſame manner as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Maſorites of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> together with the Titles, Vowels, Accents, and other marks of the Maſorites.</p>
                     <p>But though theſe, and many other Arguments of the ſame nature may be brought in defence of the Maſora, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Context of the Bible, and to prove that the Copies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias</hi> are no way to be deſpiſed, becauſe the correction was perform'd by perſons well skill'd in the Language, who determin'd the manner of reading the Hebr. Context not according to their own pleaſures, but the receiv'd Tradition; nevertheleſs, no man ought thence to collect, that all other Exemplars of the Bible are to be reform'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected after the Emendations of the Maſorites, as moſt of the Jews would obſtinately maintain. For the Greek Interpreters, and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> had alſo their <hi>Maſora,</hi> or Tradition, for the Reading and Pronunciation of the Hebrew Context, who nevertheleſs very frequently vary from the Reading of the Maſorites. And which is worthy obſervation, the moſt Learned Rabbies of the Jews, R. <hi>Juda, Jona, Aben Eſra,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50875:23"/>Kimchi,</hi> and others not a few, while they illuſtrate the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with their Commentaries, are not ſo devoted to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoretick Lection, but that ſometimes they correct it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend other Manuſcripts which they call corrected, though they differ from the Maſoreticks. Therefore as I do not think they are altogether to be favour'd, who being offended with the Jews, detract from their Copies, ſo neither are they to be imitated, who dote upon the Maſoretick Structure, and look upon it as a piece of Divinity. For thoſe upholders of Jewiſh Superſtition, ſhew themſelves unskilful in Criticiſm. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Modern Maſoretick Lection of the Context of the Bible, is not altogether to be contemned, becauſe it was not done by the Authority of men that were Prophets, and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Holy Ghoſt; for by that reaſon the Bibles of moſt of the Eaſtern Nations would be rejected, there being as much to be ſaid againſt the Chaldee, Syriack, and Arabick Exemplars, as againſt the Hebrew. There is none of them that make uſe of Tittl'd Vowels, which confine the Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and Reading within certain bounds, which were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Criticks; for that without their help the Reading not being aſcertained, was ſubject to a humour &amp; fancy. By this means the followers of that famous Impoſtor rendred the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Alcoran certain, which before was dubious and uncertain. And from theſe 'tis very probable that the Jewiſh Rabbies had their Points, and ſome other things which they introduc'd into the Hebrew Manuſcripts, to the end they might be read with more eaſe and readineſs.</p>

                     <p>But if we compare this Enumeration of the Letters of the Moſaical Law, with that which is ſet forth in the <hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> Bibles, you will find this to be very erroneous. For that allows to <hi>Geneſis</hi> no more than 4395 Letters, whereas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reckons up 78100. and therefore ſeems to be fartheſt from Truth. But why ſuch an indefatigable diligence in numbring the Letters of the Hebrew Letters with the Maſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, ſhould be call'd the hedge of the Law, by the benefit of which it is preſerv'd entire and uncorrupted from Errour or Miſtake, I cannot well apprehend: Whenas they who were ſo anxiouſly laborious, number'd in other Letters than thoſe of their own Books, which no wiſe man will look upon to be ſo free from faults, or to be compar'd with the Original. Then, as <hi>Aben Eſra</hi> rightly obſerves, the Letters <hi>Aleph, He, Vau,</hi> and <hi>Jod,</hi> are frequently added, frequently omitted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fancy of the Tranſcribers. Certainly no man that underſtands any thing of Critical Learning, will from thence only, becauſe the Maſora obſerves ſuch a word ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fill'd up, ſometimes defective, preſently infer, that all other Biblick Exemplars are not of that value, becauſe they vary in their Lections; but imbracing both Lections as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, will determine nothing certain in a thing of ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, as being taught by the Examples of the LXX Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, <hi>Aquilas, Symmachus, Theodotion,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who many times not only vary from the Maſoreth, but from one another. And therefore the Jews, and the Idolizers of the Maſorites, are miſerably deceiv'd, who believe that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ was reſtor'd to its Antient Form by a bare Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Words and Letters made by the Doctors of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias,</hi> and cry it up in the place of the Authentick Original. Than which there could be nothing more fabulouſly invented, eſpecially after ſuch a long ſucceſſion of years, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language has been as it were buried, and the Traditions of the dead almoſt entomb'd, at leaſt moſt ſtrangely interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore the more prudent <hi>Aben Eſra</hi> rightly compares the Maſoreticks that have ſo carefully enumerated the Letters and Words of the Hebrew Context to thoſe who ſhould number the Leaves and Pages of a Phyſick-Book, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50875:24"/>would nothing contribute to the health of a ſick Patient.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diſtinction of the Verſes which appears in the Maſoretick Editions, I think the ſame ſentence is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, as concerning the numbring of Letters and Words; in regard that the Authors of this Enumeration have obſerv'd no other than the Rules of Criticiſm, in diſtinguiſhing the Verſes after the manner of the Grammarians. But if we liſten to the Talmudiſts, they cry, <hi>Every Verſe which</hi> Moſes <hi>does not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, we never diſtinguiſh.</hi> But if that Tradition were receiv'd From <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherefore do not the Talmudiſts agree in all things with the Maſoriſts in this particular? Why alſo was not that Tradition of which <hi>Moſes</hi> is feign'd to be the Author, known likewiſe to thoſe Jews, that liv'd in Time of the Greek Interpreters, and St. <hi>Jerom?</hi> For they alſo differ in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things from the Maſorites. The whole Context of Sacred Writ was formerly in Antient Times written in a continu'd ſeries of words, as it had been one entire Verſe, as <hi>Elias Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> well obſerves: As alſo were the Books of the Antient Greeks and Latines; which may be collected from the Proem of <hi>Euſtathius</hi> to his Commentaries.<note place="margin">Euſtath. in Iliad.

                        <hi>The Poem of the Iliads was and continu'd a well compacted body of words; which the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſo continu'd by the command of</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>King of</hi> Athens, <hi>and fitted as they pleas'd themſelves.

                     <p>In Antient times alſo the Verſes of the Poets were not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another by any ſuch notes of diſtinction, as we find in the Printed Editions: Nor can the Grammarians themſelves rightly diſtinguiſh the Odes of <hi>Pindar.</hi> But why do I ſpend time? There's no reaſon why the Jewiſh Books in this particular ſhould have better luck than the Greek Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars of the New Teſtament, which 'tis well known were but lately diſtinguiſh'd into Verſes; as is not only to be ſeen in ſeveral of the Manuſcript Copies, but alſo in many Editions that are Printed according to the Antient Copies. True it is, that ever ſince the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the Verſes of the Law were diſtinguiſh'd in Reading. But for all that the <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any diſtinction in their Tranſcripts, as was afterwards done by the Criticks of <hi>Tyberias;</hi> to whoſe Laws the Jews are no more oblig'd, than we to the Decrees of the Apoſtolick See, which after the Correction of the Latine Interpretation, decreed that no other Interpretation ſhould be Printed for the future, unleſs it were examin'd by the Vatican Standard: Which Edict was for the procurement of Peace and Concord: And to this as much as is poſſible, they who gave the <hi>Roman</hi> Church her Name, will adhere in explaining the Latine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, if they be wiſe, obſerving the Points, and all the marks of diſtinction in that Edition. Nevertheleſs, that a clearer and more probable ſenſe will riſe from another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſtinction, they do not ſcruple to prefer it before the Vulgar Diſtinction in their Commentaries. In which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the Jews agree very well with the Catholick Divines, who do not depend ſo much upon the Maſoretick Diſtinctions, as to make it a point of Conſcience not to depart from them, when the receiv'd Diſtinctions will not yield a ſenſe ſo proper and conſentaneous to the Context. To which we may add the Infinite Variety of Manuſcript Copies, which differ many times as to theſe matters as well from themſelves, as from the Maſoreticks.</p>

And the ſetters forth of the Book were wont at the end of their works, to add the number of the Verſes therein contain'd, that thereby they might prevent Additions or Diminutions, which might be obtruded upon them. Thus <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> tells us the largeneſs or ſmalneſs of the Books which he cites in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by giving an account of the number of the Verſes of which they conſiſt. In the ſame manner were the Volumes of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> compil'd, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems to intimate, where he ſays, that there were ſeven or eight hundred Verſes wanting. In the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> according to the Antient Edition of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Interpreter, the Verſes are frequently reckon'd up at the end of the Samaritan, Syriack and Arabick Copies. So that 'tis probable that the Jews deriv'd this Cuſtom from the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, and they from the Greeks, which afterwards the ſubtle Rabbies enlarg'd according as their Fancies prompted them. But there was a neceſſity for them to diſtinguiſh other Verſes, by reaſon of their Readings and Leſſons in the Synagogues; to which they put a full ſtop, not according to the number of words or letters, but according as the ſenſe guided them. For that from the time that the Hebrew Language began to fail the Jews, they never read the Law without an Interpreter, who repeated it, as it was read to the people, in the Language they underſtood. And thus the Interpreter follow'd the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when he had read one Verſe, which was ſuch a ſhort Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as might eaſily be deliver'd to the People, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to the memory; which being read and interpreted, then the Reader read another, and then another, till he came to ſome new matter; ſo that his Leſſons for Morning and Evening were therefore divided into Verſes. Nor can there be invented any other Original of thoſe Verſes which are point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias</hi> in the Sacred Context, to be ſeen in the Editions of every Bible, Although there were another ſort of Verſes well known to thoſe of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do ſometimes reckon up the Words and Letters of which the Verſes conſiſt.</p>

Wherefore in this place the Maſorite Exemplars va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is evident by the abſence of the <hi>Keri</hi> upon this place in ſome of the Bibles extant. Chap. 5. v. 1. in the Context it is <hi>Gnal Gnabranou;</hi> the <hi>Keri</hi> reads it <hi>Gnabram, till they paſſed over;</hi> as it is without emendation in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Edition, Chap. 6. v. 8. the Context reads the word <hi>Thok'gnau,</hi> the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>Keri</hi> reads it <hi>Thok'gnei,</hi> as if <hi>Vau</hi> had crept in inſtead of <hi>Jod,</hi> which Reading the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> admits without any more trouble. Chap. 8. v. 16. the Context reads <hi>Ba Gnair,</hi> the <hi>Keri</hi> alters it, <hi>Ba Gnai,</hi> in <hi>Ai,</hi> as if the <hi>Reſch</hi> were to be caſt away, which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Edition does to their hands.

V. 36. In ſome Copies, of which one was accurately Printed at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> by <hi>Judaeus Manaſſes,</hi> over againſt the name <hi>Tſephi,</hi> the <hi>Keri</hi> reads <hi>Tſephu</hi> with a <hi>Vau,</hi> not with a <hi>Jod,</hi> as it is in the cited Edition, which confirms the Maſora. The ſame Edition alſo reads <hi>Dodanim,</hi> with a <hi>Daleth,</hi> as in the Pentateuch, not <hi>Rodanim,</hi> with a <hi>Reſch,</hi> as in the Vulgar Editions. For <hi>Shephi,</hi> v. 40. with a <hi>Jod,</hi> this Edition read <hi>Shephiu</hi> with a <hi>Vau.</hi> V. 46. the Context reads <hi>Gnaiuth</hi> with a <hi>Vau</hi> after the <hi>Jod,</hi> the <hi>Keri</hi> alters it <hi>Gnavith,</hi> or <hi>Avith,</hi> as it is corrected in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Edition. Laſtly, V. 51. the Context reads <hi>Duo Gnaljah;</hi> the Maſora corrects it <hi>Gnalvah,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Copy. So that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Edition above recited, obſerves no other than the Maſoretick Emendations. In the laſt verſe of the 3d chap. the Context reads <hi>Hodijahu,</hi> the <hi>Keri Hodavaihu,</hi> as if the <hi>Jod</hi> and <hi>Vau</hi> had been tranſpos'd, which Emendation of the <hi>Keri</hi> is obſerv'd in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Edition. Chap. 4. v. 7. The Context reads <hi>Jetſochar,</hi> the <hi>Keri</hi> alters it <hi>Vetſochar,</hi> which the Manuſcript Copy follows.

Chap. 6. v. 26. the Context reads <gap reason="foreign">

In the ſame chapter the Context reads <hi>Tſiph</hi> inſtead of <hi>Tſoph,</hi> corrected by the <hi>Maſorak,</hi> and confirmed by the Authority of four Manuſcripts. In the 7th chap. v. 1. the Context reads <hi>Jaſhib,</hi> the <hi>Keri Jaſhub,</hi> and in one Manuſcript the Maſoretick Emendation is followed. But for theſe particulars let this ſuffice. For it may ſeem ſuperfluous to note the reſt, ſeeing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50875:29"/>there is the ſame reaſon for the one as for the other. For if thoſe Lections which are added in the Margin of the Hebrew Context in moſt Bibles under the Directions of <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cetib,</hi> were but compar'd with five or ſix of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manuſcripts, which are to be preferr'd before the reſt, we ſhould find all the Maſoretick Corrections to agree with them. Whence it appears that the Criticks of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> in imitation of the other Criticks, made no alterations, at leaſt in this particular, without the aſſiſtance of the Manuſcript Copies. And firſt it is worthy obſervation, that the more of Antiquity and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thoſe Manuſcript Copies appear to have, the more they agree with the Maſoretick Emendations. Therefore as Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes, we may perceive the genuine Original of <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cetib.</hi> But in vain do ſome Learned men ſeem to labour, while they enumerate theſe varieties of <hi>Lections,</hi> thence to make out that there are varieties of Readings to be alſo found in the Hebrew Context. For that, no man of judgment ever deny'd, even among the Jews; though they bring all varian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture to the Maſora as to a certain ſtandard. It would be much better therefore to examine the Maſoretick Corrections of <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cetib,</hi> by the Manuſcript Copies of the Bible, than to extend them out into a long ſeries, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their number by all manner of ways. Whenas it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the greateſt part of them are the manifeſt Errours of the Tranſcribers, which might be eaſily reform'd without the Manuſcript Copies. But in this the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias</hi> ſeem'd to be more devout, who durſt not put their Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Context, though they were certain they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the manifeſt Errours of the Scribe; but either they referr'd to them in the Margin, or put them apart in ſheets by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Which Religion, if not rather Superſtition of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites, carry'd headlong the Jews that followed them, into ſeveral Fictions concerning thoſe Critical Annotations. While they adventur'd to ſpend their judgments, not ſo much from the truth of the thing, or the Rules of true Criticiſm, but out of their own brains accuſtom'd to imagine Miracles and Stories.</p>
                     <p>Beſides thoſe varieties of Lections already by us repeated, there are alſo others that may be referr'd to <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cetib;</hi> ſuch as are thoſe words, which the Maſorites mark under the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50875:30"/>directions of <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cetil,</hi> or <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>not written,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that really they are not inſerted in the Text it ſelf; only there is a vacant ſpace left, and the Vowels mark'd with Points, which are erroneous in thoſe words; and written whole in the Margin, with this note <hi>Keri velo Cetib, read, but not written.</hi> But theſe things will be made much plainer by Examples, and their Original will be the more eaſily found, if they be examin'd by the Copies of the Manuſcript Bibles.</p>
                     <p>In the 20th chapter of <hi>Judges, v.</hi> 13. the Text is thus Printed <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to which the Maſora ſupplies <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nei</hi> in the Margin with this note <hi>Keri velo Cetib,</hi> that is the word <gap reason="foreign">

Though in a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manuſcript, and that of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the whole Sentence is writ at length, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; which a Jewiſh Criticaſter was ſo impatient to ſee, that after he had added the Maſoretick note in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, he ras'd out the word <hi>Benei</hi> out of a moſt lovely Copy, to make way for the void ſpace and the mark of the Maſorites, which you ſhall often find done by thoſe Idolizers of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora, eſpecially in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manuſcripts, which they ſtrive to reform according to the Maſoretick Corrections. Thus in the 3d chapter of <hi>Ruth,</hi> v. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, oppoſite to which ſtands <hi>Keri velo Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tib,</hi> which however is right in our Manuſcript. The ſame paſſages may be obſerv'd 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> c. 14. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> c. 20. and in other places, which nevertheleſs are written in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, as the Maſora directs them to be read. In 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 29.31. <hi>The Zeal of the Lord hath done this; Tſevaoth,</hi> of Hoſts, is omitted; and therefore the <hi>Maſora</hi> makes this note in the Margin; <hi>The word</hi> Tſevaoth <hi>ought to be read, but let it not be written;</hi> yet it is written down in the Manuſcript Copy. Now what has been ſaid concerning <hi>Keri velo Cetib, to be read, and not written,</hi> is likewiſe to be ſaid of the quite contrary Maſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick note, <hi>Cetib velo Keri, to be written, not read.</hi> Thus <hi>Ruth,</hi> c. 3. v. 12. The Text reads <hi>Chi 'im Goel Anoki, That I am thy near Kinſman.</hi> Where the Maſorites note that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Im,</hi> is not to be <hi>read, though it be written.</hi> This is then the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50875:30"/>between <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cetib,</hi> and <hi>Cetib</hi> and <hi>Keri,</hi> that the one ſupplies the defect of words in the publiſh'd Editions, with words of more Authority out of the Manuſcripts; the other cuts off ſuch as are deem'd ſuperfluous. So that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of Myſtery, as the Jews vainly dream in the Animadverſions of the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> which in this m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tter has not been before perform'd by other Criticks in the Greek and Latine Bibles, and that with more ſucceſs, and leſs Superſtition.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of certain words, which the Maſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Criticks thought fit to expunge out of the Text, as ſeeming to them to be ſomewhat obſcene. For as R. <hi>Moſes</hi> teſtifies, the Hebrew is called the Holy Language, which will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any words that carry any ſemblance of obſcenity. But the falſhood of this is eaſily proved. Beſides, that alteration is not eaſily diſcern'd in the Manuſcript Copies, and therefore is to be little regarded. And therefore I would be a means, that what words are left out of the Text without any cauſe, ſhould be again reſtor'd to it. Now from what has been ſaid, it may be concluded, that many of the various Lections are unprofitably mark'd by the Maſoreths, which were the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Errours of the Scribes. In which thing <hi>Cappellus</hi> and <hi>Morinus</hi> ſhew themſelves the more inveterate againſt the Jews, while they multiply the number of the various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of ſundry Editions of the Bible compar'd together; whereas the manifeſt Errours of the Scribes ought not to be accounted various Readings. On the other ſide <hi>John Viccars</hi> leſſens their number more than he ought, affirming, that in ſeveral Manuſcript Bibles, which he found in ſundry Libraries of <hi>Italy,</hi> he met with no ſuch thing as <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cetib.</hi> True it is, there are much fewer in the Manuſcript Copies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> but I never met with any Manuſcript yet, where diverſity of Reading was altogether abſent.</p>

The Jews vulgarly believe ſome Myſtery lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd under theſe things. And <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> who ſolely depends upon the Jewiſh Writings, thus delivers himſelf concerning thoſe Letters. <hi>There is no queſtion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but the cauſes of thoſe diverſities ſeem'd worthy and juſt to thoſe wiſe and prudent perſons in former Ages,</hi>

                        <hi>but the various Exilements, and grievous Calamities of their Poſterity, have buried them in oblivion, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd them into various Figments and fond Myſteries.</hi> Thus <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> rather chuſes to make himſelf a Patron of Maſoretick Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, than to enquire into the cauſe of that Superſtitious Writing; which Superſtition ſhews it ſelf in this, that the Modern Exemplars of the Bibles, which were examin'd by the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> are ſome leſſer, ſome bigger than others; ſome turn'd inward, others hanging downward. The cauſe of which ſeems to be no other, than that the hands of the Scribes could not ſo make the Letters of Lines extended in length, as to be every way equal one with another; whence it happen'd that ſome varied in ſhape from the reſt. It might ſo fall out alſo, that ſome Letters at the beginning of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, might be made bigger of ſet purpoſe; as <hi>Aleph</hi> and <hi>Beth;</hi> of which the one is the firſt Letter in the beginning of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the other of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> But the Jews, who knew how to fetch out a Myſtery out of the leaſt tittle of a Letter, began to conceit new Fictions upon this Writing; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by virtue of the Authority of the Doctors that firſt invented theſe Fables, being receiv'd by the reſt of the Jews, were eaſily propagated to Poſterity.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:50875:31"/>
                     <p>But though the uſe, or rather abuſe of thoſe Letters ſeems to be very antient, and long accuſtom'd by the Maſorites, yet have I found a vaſt difference in the obſervance of thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineations between the Exemplars of the Manuſcript Bibles and thoſe: For in thoſe there are fewer Examples of thoſe Letters; or if you meet with any, the form of the Letter is hardly diſcern'd to differ from the other. Thus the bigneſs of the Letter <hi>Aleph,</hi> which is the firſt in the Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and <hi>Beth</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Copies, is ſcarcely to be diſcern'd; ſo ſmall is the difference between them and the reſt. In one <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Copy written about ſome 10 years ſince thoſe trifles are altogether neglected. Thus <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> c. 56.10. In the Maſoretick Bibles the word <hi>Tſophau,</hi> or <hi>Watchmen,</hi> is Printed with a great <gap reason="foreign">

Thus in the 44th chapter of the ſame Prophet, where we read in the Text <gap reason="foreign">

However, it is probable that this variety of Character, which at firſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only from the careleſs and negligent humour of the Scribes, as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of writing the <hi>Heb.</hi> Text uncertain.</note> gave the Jews an occaſion to ground many Myſteries upon it, as being perſons that will ſpring a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle out of a Shoe-latchet. As for the writing of <hi>Aleph,</hi> it was always uncertain from the very time that the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Originals of the Sacred Text were loſt by the Jews: So that it ſolely depends upon the will of the Jews, as may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prov'd by comparing the moſt Authentick Manuſcripts with the publiſh'd Editions. For they differ in a thouſand
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50875:32"/>places, ſo that I could number above ſix thouſand of thoſe Letters which are not extant in the publick Exemplars.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Criticks of <hi>Tyberias</hi> in vain turmoil'd and weari'd themſelves in counting how many times this or that word was full, and how many times defective. For example, they diligently conſider how many times the word <hi>Otham</hi> is written at large in the Text; they obſerve that it was written in the Law thirty nine times full, or with the Letter <hi>Vau;</hi> and thus they run through all the Books of Scripture. But upon comparing the Manuſcripts together, they could never once agree among themſelves after what manner the ſaid word was to be written. Moreover, this word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> being fully thus written, does not only ſignify <hi>them</hi> or <hi>thoſe,</hi> which is its true and genuine ſignification, but ſometimes, <hi>with them,</hi> as if it were written <hi>Ittham;</hi> and were defective in the writing. So true it is that in theſe words, the ſence and not the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is to be regarded. But above all there is nothing like the Superſtitious niceneſs of the Jews in writing the word <hi>Ieruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaim,</hi> while they diligently obſerve all the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where it is to be writ at length with a Jod, and where without. And yet neither the Hebrew Manuſcripts, nor the Maſoretick Examplars, agree one among another. How many fictions have they raiſed about the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>Meoroth</hi> or Lights, which in the Beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is written without a <hi>Vau,</hi> contrary to the rules of Proportion; and becauſe the Jewiſh Rabbies have raiſed a thouſand fictions from this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing ſuch a Notable word, hence the Scribes have been very careful to obſerve that manner of ſpelling,</p>
                     <p>True it is that the Inſertion or Omiſſion of thoſe letters, which depend upon the pleaſure of the Scribes, ſeldom preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the ſenſe, and therefore in ſuch caſes, neither the one nor the other, is of any moment. But ſometimes it happens, that they alter the ſenſe. As 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. In the third of <hi>Sophonia</hi> where we read <hi>Nogue, Sad,</hi> as the Interpreters vulgarly render it from <hi>Jaga,</hi> Rabbi <hi>Solomon</hi> expounds it remote or forraign as if it came from the Root <hi>Haga,</hi> without any regard to the Maſoretick reading. There are not wanting ſome Rabbies, who derive the word <hi>Nechiloth</hi> in the Title of the 5. <hi>Pſalm</hi> from <hi>Chalal,</hi> as if it were to be written without a <hi>Jod;</hi> not much heeding the Rules of the Maſorites, for full and defective
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50875:33"/>words. I omit above ſix hundred of this nature frequently to be met with in the Commentaries of the Jews, by which the Greek Tranſlations of the LXX. Interpreters, and the Latine of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> may be Illuſtrated in many places. Neither is St. <hi>Jerome</hi> to be commended for this, that he blames the Greek Interpreters, for differing ſometimes from him in that ſort of reading. For this reaſon he taxes thoſe, who in the 14. Chapt of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> for <hi>Angels,</hi> as it is in the Hebrew Exemplar, tranſlate Kings, becauſe that in their Copies they find the word <hi>Malkim,</hi> without the Letter <hi>Aleph,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">

But the Greek Interpreters were not to be governed ſo much by the reading of Copies, as by the ſenſe which was moſt proper to the place, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Manuſcripts and printed Editions, do not agree about the Inſertion of the Letter <hi>Aleph.</hi> As in <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>v.</hi> 18. Where the modern Exemplars read <hi>Limleketh, to the Queen,</hi> without an <hi>Aleph,</hi> yet in a ſingle Manuſcript, it is written with an <hi>Aleph</hi>

                     <p>AFter that the Hebrew Language ceas'd to be familiarly ſpoken among the Jews, and that the Chaldee Language became the Speech of the Country, the Writers made many alterations in their Tranſcriptions, by reaſon of the Affinity of the Languages. Nor were they ſo curious of neat Letters as they were before. From whence without queſtion it came to paſs, that the Letter <hi>Aleph,</hi> ſo much in uſe among the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans,</hi> is many times miſtaken for the Letter <hi>He,</hi> and added to words without any reaſon. And from hence I ſuppoſe it happened, that there are ſo many <hi>Chaldaeiſms</hi> in the Hebrew Text; as <hi>Shelechebeth, Flame</hi> by the Addition of the Letter <hi>Schin,</hi> according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Chaldeans. Magnath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50875:33"/>abin</hi> and <hi>Calabin</hi> inſtead of <hi>Magnathabim</hi> and <hi>Calabim,</hi> with ſeveral others of the ſame nature, which I omit, that I may come to thoſe other variations of writing, frequent in the Manuſcript Copies of moſt credit and Authority.</p>
                     <p>In the writing of theſe words <hi>El, Elohim, Jehovah, Col</hi> and the like, which are frequently redundant with the Greek Interpreters, the Manuſcript Copies do not a little vary from the printed <hi>Maſoreticks.</hi> Which, becauſe they are more frequent in ſpeech, are ſometimes inſerted, ſometimes omitted by the Scribes. Thus in the beginning of the 16. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is thus repeated in one Spaniſh Copy: Thou haſt ſaid <hi>Jehovah, L' Jehovah, Jehovah,</hi> to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> thou art my Lord; but in the modern exemplar only once. In the ſame exemplar, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 3. The word <hi>Jehovah</hi> is thus, twice repeated, <hi>The day of the Lord, the day of the Lord approaches.</hi> But the Maſoretick Copy repeats <hi>the Lord</hi> but once; nor does St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeem to have read it otherwiſe in his exemplars. Neither do the Seventy Interpreters repeat the ſentence, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more then once, <hi>the day of the Lord approaches.</hi> On the other ſide, in the ſame <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manuſcript, <hi>Judges</hi> 1.1. The word <hi>Col</hi> is omitted; and the Lection is thus: The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went forth, but in the printed Editions, <hi>Col Benei, All the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>went forth.</hi> But it is needleſs to repeat any more examples of theſe Variances, which nevertheleſs, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> writing to <hi>Sunias</hi> and <hi>Fretelas</hi> very carefully enumerates, for the thing it ſelf informs us, that thoſe ſorts of words, might eaſily have been added or omitted in the tranſcribing of the Copies.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in the Spaniſh Manuſcript already recited, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the 2d. Chap. of the 1 Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the Lection is conformable to the Greek Interpreters, and to what St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had read in his Copies. <hi>Maacha Calebs Concubine; brought forth Seber and Thirana.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Copy reads, <hi>Jal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> brought forth, in the Faeminine Gender, but in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoretick Editions, it is written <hi>Jahad</hi> in the Maſculine Gender, he begot, and ſo cannot be joyned with the Faeminine <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina,</hi> or Concubine. Wherefore the modern Interpreters of the ſacred Text, who follow the Maſorites over zealouſly, for fear of erring againſt the rules of Grammar, make uſe of this Periphraſis, <hi>Maacha Caleb's Concubine, of whom he begat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50875:34"/>Sebar and Thirana.</hi> In the 3d Chapter <hi>v.</hi> 19. of the ſame Book, where we find in the Printed Books, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ben Zerubbabel</hi> with a Maſoretick marking the margent, denoting the Opinion of the Maſorites, that it ſhould be read in the Plural Number <hi>Benei,</hi> and not in the ſingular <hi>Ben,</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Copy, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be <hi>Benei,</hi> in the Plural. In the 6 Chap. of the ſame Book, inſtead of <hi>Michael,</hi> as it is in our Exemplars, the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Copy, reads <hi>Malachie;</hi> and in another place, inſtead of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> another Manuſcript reads <hi>Azaria.</hi> In the eighth Chap. of <hi>Joſuah. v.</hi> 22. The Manuſcript Copy, reads <hi>Lo</hi> in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Number, with this note in the Margent, <hi>Lahem</hi> in another Copy, which Lection is now obſerved in the modern context: The Particle <hi>Lo,</hi> Not, and <hi>Eth</hi> which is the ſign of the accuſative caſe, are not always written in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the Manuſcripts, as in the Printed Exemplars.</p>
                     <p>Of far greater moment is that difference, which is found in 21. Chap of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> wherein there is a want of two verſes, which are notwithſtanding both in the Greek and Latine Editions, which that they ought not to have been left out, the thing it ſelf declares, when in recounting the Cities allotted to the <hi>Levites</hi> out of every Tribe; the Tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> could not have been omitted. Beſides theſe verſes are ſupplied by five <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of beſt note, as alſo by the Royal <hi>Pariſian</hi> the Engliſh, the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enetian</hi> of <hi>Bemberg,</hi> and <hi>Bragand</hi> in <hi>Quarto,</hi> the <hi>Plantinian</hi> in <hi>Quarto,</hi> Robert <hi>Stephanus</hi>'s and that of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and other. Againſt all theſe the learned <hi>Maſius</hi> oppoſes the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Maſora</hi> and R. <hi>D. Kimchi.</hi> From whence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that none of thoſe verſes were extant in the Ancient Manuſcripts. And <hi>Maſius</hi> farther obſerves, that none of thoſe Bibles wherein thoſe verſes are to be found, make any mention of <hi>Jordan, Jericho,</hi> or the Cities of Refuge. Only in one <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manuſcript, there is mention made of a City of Refuge, which none of the exemplars, hitherto printed, allow: But there was no need of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Jordan</hi> or <hi>Jericho,</hi> becauſe the number of the Cities is made up without them. <hi>Johannes Morinus,</hi> who has commented more largely upon this place, believes theſe verſes to have been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated by the injury of time, &amp; the negligence of th Jews; which ſeems moſt probable: But in the ſame place, he erroneouſly obſerves, that the two Comma's which were in the Manuſcript by him cited, were afterwards eras'd by him that tranſcribed it, this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50875:34"/>annotation being added in the Margin, we found not theſe two verſes in the <hi>Hillelian</hi> Exemplar; for in peruſing that Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, I perceived that note to be added by ſome Jewiſh Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticaſter, long after the tranſcribing of the Copy, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it ſome of the tittled Vowels and ſome parts of the Maſora beſide. For that ſame Criticaſter was deſirous, that his Exemplar ſhould conform in all things, to the Maſoretick, and to gain the more credit to his Emendation, he cited the <hi>Hillelian</hi> Manuſcript. Therefore D. <hi>Kimchi,</hi> ſeems more addicted then was needful to the Lection of the Maſorites, while he affirms that he never ſaw thoſe two verſes, which are wanting in the Maſoretick Edition, in any ancient corrected Exemplar, but only noted in. Neither does <hi>Grotius</hi> weigh thoſe verſes, with a ſufficient accuratneſs, ſuſpecting them to have been added out of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> to the Book of <hi>Joſua;</hi> after <hi>Kimchi</hi>'s time, and thence crept into the Greek and Latine verſions. On the other ſide <hi>Morinus</hi> believes them to have been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated out of the Book of <hi>Joſua,</hi> into the <hi>Chronicles</hi> by <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and afterwards left out through the careleſneſs of the Scribes. Which miſtake of the Scribes, might in this particular more eaſily happen by reaſon of the frequent repetition of the word, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mematteh, and of the Tribe, &amp;c.</hi> Whence it came to paſs, that afterwards, the ſeveral Manuſcripts did not conſtantly retain the ſame order of ſentences. In a manner not much unlike to this, the ancient Jewiſh Scribes made many more miſtakes, eſpecially in the accompts of their families. For the ſame words, and the ſame Phraſes often occurring to their fancies, as they wrote, great confuſion by that means crept into the Books of ſacred Scripture, as may be eaſily apparent to any one that ſhall compare the Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> with the other Hiſtorians. For tho it be not permitted, to correct the firſt from the latter, yet is it moſt apparent, that there are many things wanting in both, that might be reſtored from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, eſpecially the Greek Interpretations; the authors of which had Copies differing from the publick Exemplars of the Bible: Whoſe different writings I paſs over in ſilence, as being obvious to all, and aiming only at thoſe which may be taken out of the Manuſcript Copies of the Jews. And indeed thoſe Errours have been in the Hebrew Codex of an ancient ſtanding. But when any Jewiſh Rabbi has got himſelf a name
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50875:35"/>for le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rning among his Country-men, preſently taking a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe, they reformed their own Manuſcripts by ſuch a ones Copy, rejecting the more ancient Books. Such among the Jews, were the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> R. <hi>R. Ben Aſcer, Ben Naphtali, Hillel,</hi> and ſeveral others to us unknown. By this means it came to paſs, that the Ancient Exemplars of the Bible being laid aſide, the differences of writing in things of greateſt moment were likewiſe loſt. All which things may be demonſtrated from other Books of the Jews. For if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the written with the printed, and thoſe which were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht in ſeveral times and at ſeveral places, 'tis a wonderful thing, to ſee how they differ one from another. Thus the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Book entitled <hi>Jetſira,</hi> or, <hi>of the Creation,</hi> which the Jews falſely attribute to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Patriarch, differs egregiouſly from it ſelf in ſeveral Editions, and ſtill there is more diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Printed Copies. Moreover the Latine verſion of this little treatiſe, in many things diſagrees as well from the Manuſcripts as printed Editions. So that they who lookt after the <hi>Mantuan</hi> Edition, found the vaſt difficulty of publiſhing that ſmall. Tract, to conſiſt as well in quantity as quality. The ſame publiſhers alſo obſerved, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, who adorned it with their commentaries, do very much differ in the reconciliation of the Text. And indeed in the <hi>Mantuan</hi> Edition, there is extant another Copy of that Book, not much different from the firſt. In like manner if you compare the Manuſcript Copies of that famous piece en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titl'd <hi>Zohar,</hi> either with themſelves or with the printed Copies, you will find a very great diſcrepancy among them. Nor need you look any further then the Edition of that Book printed at <hi>Cremona,</hi> wherein the various Lections, which are almoſt infinite, are ſedulouſly noted. The ſame may be obſerved in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Copies of the Book entitl'd <hi>Cozri,</hi> of which one was written. But I ſhall inſiſt no longer upon theſe things. Certainly the extream diligence and Induſtry of the Jews is highly to be applauded, who have ſo ſtudiouſly obſerved the readings of various Exemplars. On the other ſide they were highly to be blamed, who making no mention of the Books from whence they took their Editions, make corrections of them as they think fit themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I would have it, that thoſe places of ſacred Text
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50875:35"/>which bad Connexion tells us to be falſe or corrupted, ſhould be reſtored by the aſſiſtance of the moſt Ancient Interpreters, ſeeing in things of leſſer conſequence, the Manuſcripts may help. For the miſtakes are very ancient, but the Written Copies of a later age, and reformed according to the rule of the <hi>Maſora.</hi> So that although as well in the Manuſcripts as in the printed Copies, the 13. verſe of the 145. <hi>Pſalm</hi> be wanting, it might be eaſily ſupplyed out of the Ancient Interpreters, which have it in their tranſlations. <hi>It is not to be doubted,</hi> ſays Grotius,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>but that this verſe was loſt out of the Hebrew Copies through the negligence of the Tranſcribers, for there wants a verſe which ſhould begin with the letter</hi> Nun. <hi>And ſoon after he adds, How will they anſwer this, who would have us ſtand to all the decrees of the Maſorites?</hi> In which words he aims at our Maſora worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, by whom the Hebrew Text is lookt upon to be the ſame with what it was in the times of the Prophets. So obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate are they in the defence of their <hi>Maſora.</hi> But in theſe and the like defects, the verſions of the Ancient Interpreters as well Greek as Latin, ſupply the place of the Hebrew Exemplar: Nor is it unuſual for the Criticks who Tranſlate Greek or Latin into any other Language, to have recourſe to more Ancient Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, to Illuſtrate the Lections of thoſe books which they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate: Which was ſucceſsfully obſerved by ſome in the Tranſlation of the N.

                     <p>Laſtly, That the plenty of Jewiſh Exemplars of the Hebrew context, fell very ſhort toward the aſſiſtance of the Jews of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> is prov'd, not only by the Teſtimonies of R. <hi>R. Judas, Jonas, Aben Eſra, Kimchi</hi> and others, who ſometimes quote the Manuſcript Copies, and thoſe the moſt corrected; but alſo by the Annotations of Ben <hi>Hajim,</hi> who firſt collected into one Body, the diſpers'd parts of the <hi>Maſora,</hi> and ſet them forth in Print. For he has added other Lections beſides the Maſoretick to the Margent of the Venetian Bible, which he aſſures us he had gathered from moſt approved Manuſcripts. Thus upon the word <hi>Cheſoos, as a crane, Iſaiah.</hi> 38.14. He has made this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary annotation in the margent; <hi>In ſome Copies it is written ch'ſis with a</hi> Jod, <hi>and the notes direct it to be read Ch'ſoos, but I found not this in the Catalogue of thoſe words which having</hi> Jod <hi>in the middle, are to be read with the Letter</hi> Vau.

But here it may not be improper to add a few words more concerning the moſt ſelect Editions of thoſe Bibles. The Hebrew Bibles,<note place="margin">The moſt Select Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Hebrew Bibles.</note> whoſe Editions were over-lookt by the Jews, are far more corrected than thoſe which were publiſh'd by the Chriſtians. Wherefore <hi>Elias Levita</hi> rejected the Bible which was ſet forth by <hi>Bomberg</hi> in <hi>Folio</hi> at <hi>Venice, Anno</hi> 1518. <hi>Felix Pratenſis</hi> leading the way, as not being well corrected, eſpecially in the <hi>Maſora,</hi> which <hi>Pratenſis</hi> ſeems not to have well underſtood. Therefore that Bible was of much more credit, which was publiſh'd by R. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Hajim,</hi> Reſtorer of the Maſora at the coſt and charges of the ſame <hi>Bomberg.</hi> For in this there is not only Printed the Hebrew Text, but the Targum, or Chaldee Paraphraſe, with Commentaries of the moſt Learned Jews, both upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and both the Maſora's, as well the larger as the leſs. The ſame Bibles were again Printed at <hi>Venice Anno</hi> 1618. But this Edition was much inferiour to the reſt, there being many things reform'd and amended, or rather ſpoil'd by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, eſpecially in the Commentaries of the Rabbins. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bible was alſo ſet forth at <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Daniel Bomberg,</hi> but leſs exact. Nevertheleſs, thoſe are not to be contemn'd which the Jews caus'd to be put forth for their own uſe at <hi>Piſaurum, Sabioneſa, Mantua, Frankfort,</hi> and other places. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> alſo publiſh'd a new Edition of <hi>Bomberg</hi>'s Bible, which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd by R. <hi>Jacob Ben Hajim,</hi> which he believes to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in many things by himſelf, eſpecially in reference to the Tittl'd Vowel of the Chaldee Text. But as for the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Printed at <hi>Baſil</hi> 1608. it ſeems much inferiour to that of <hi>Bomberg,</hi> out of which it was taken, and is contemn'd by the Jews. Imperfect alſo are the Bibles Printed by <hi>Robert Stephens</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50875:37"/>in <hi>Quarto</hi> and <hi>Decimo Sexto,</hi> and by <hi>Plantin</hi> in <hi>Quarto,</hi> and in other Volumes, compar'd with that which R. <hi>Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael</hi> and other Jews caus'd to be Printed at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in <hi>Quarto</hi> 1635. and in <hi>Octavo</hi> 1661. Moreover, the Jews, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they who inhabit the Eaſtern parts, highly commend an Edition ſet forth at <hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>Quarto,</hi> in a large Paper by <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſus,</hi> which contains the Literal Notes. The Rabbi alſo himſelf explains the moſt difficult places of the Text in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue. To theſe might be added other Editions of the Bible, and thoſe a great many publiſh'd by the Jews, not only in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> but at <hi>Conſtantinople, Theſſalonica,</hi> and <hi>Hadrianople,</hi> but it ſuffices to have given an account of the moſt remarkable. We have alſo ſaid, that the Chriſtian Bibles are not ſo accurate as thoſe ſet forth by the Jews, but the Chriſtian Characters are far ſuperiour to thoſe of the Jews. The Five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo are ſet forth apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with a threefold Targum and the Commentaries of <hi>Solomon Iſaac.</hi> Thus was the Pentateuch printed at <hi>Hanovia</hi> 1611. with verſes diſtinguiſhed by Number according to the Latin Editions.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Whether the Jews corrupled their Bibles of ſet purpoſe. The Opinion of the Fathers concerning this matter examined.</head>
                     <p>ALthough there be a very great difference between the Exemplars of the Hebrew Context, which are now extant, and thoſe which the Seventy Interpreters and St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> made uſe of, and that in our days they very much vary one from another; yet we ought not thence to conclude, that the Jewiſh Bibles were by themſelves corrupted, in hatred of the Chriſtians, as ſome Divines bearing no good will to the Jews,<note place="margin">Leo Caſtro.</note> have been pleas'd to report. <hi>Leo Caſtro,</hi> a Spaniſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, urges highly for this the common opinion of the Fathers, and produces a great train of their Teſtimonies. After the ſame manner <hi>Johannes Morinus</hi> ſhews himſelf ſomewhat too ſevere againſt the Jews, for though he adjudge this Opinion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50875:37"/>not altogether ſo probable, yet he muſters up a long Catalogue of the maintainers of it, to impoſe upon the more ignorant. And what ſeems to exceed all belief, <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> among the <hi>Heterodox,</hi> has uttered many bitter reproaches againſt the Jews as adulterators of ſacred Writ. But if the weight of their reaſons be conſidered, rather than the number of their reaſons, we ſhall find their accuſations to have quite another face. True it is, that they condemn under the name of the Jews, the verſions of <hi>Aquilas, Theodotion</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> in regard that the Jews continually ſet them up in oppoſition to the Septuagint. Therefore as often as the Fathers queſtion the Jews for corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſacred Scripture, they only ſpeak of thoſe verſions, or of ſomething like them, as hereafter we ſhall make it appear. Upon which accompt St. <hi>Jerom</hi> labouring to excuſe himſelf, for having tranſlated the Scripture out of Hebrew into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, gives this reaſon:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 89.</note> 
                        <hi>I have not ſo much endeavoured to aboliſh the Ancient, as to produce thoſe Teſtimonies, which by the Jews are either omitted or corrupted, that ours might underſtand what the Hebrew truth contains.</hi> In which words he ſharply taxes <hi>Aquilas, Symmachus</hi> and other Interpreters, whom he frequently calls by the title of Semi-Chriſtians. For when the Fathers in their diſputes with the Jews, concerning the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, made uſe againſt them, of no other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but the Septuagint; on the other ſide, the Jews ſtill had recourſe to the Hebrew Books, that is, to <hi>Aquila</hi> and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, who had made new tranſlations out of the Hebrew; for this reaſon chiefly was St. <hi>Jerom</hi> induc'd, to make a new tranſlation from the ſame fountains: And for the ſame reaſon <hi>Origen</hi> before him had compos'd his <hi>Hexapla</hi> with wonderful Art.</p>

                        <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord,</hi> to <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> which are only to be underſtood of Chriſt: As alſo their miſapplication of the words of <hi>Iſaiah, Before a child knows to call his Father and his Mother,</hi> &amp;c. To the ſame <hi>Ezechiah;</hi> which as he demonſtrates, ought to be interpreted concerning Chriſt. Then he affirms many things to have been taken out of Scripture, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of the Jews, becauſe they favoured the Chriſtian
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50875:38"/>Religion; and then that ſome words were changed into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. However in all this there is nothing argu'd againſt, but the perverſe expoſition of the context, or miſinterpretation, not againſt the text it ſelf; in regard <hi>Juſtin</hi> could give no Judgment concerning the Integrity or falſhood of that, as being one that was utterly Ignorant of the Hebrew Language, which is palpable from the Etymology, which he gives of the word <hi>Iſrael. This name</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaith he, ſignifies a man overcoming Power; For</hi> Iſra <hi>is a man, and</hi> El <hi>Power.</hi> But this above all the reſt is moſt worthy obſervation, that <hi>Juſtin</hi> by the word Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands nothing but the Tranſlation of the ſeventy Interpreters. So that when he accuſes the Jews for depraving the Scripture, he alſo taxes the verſion of <hi>Aquila,</hi> which in many things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Septuagint. Which led ſeveral learned men into miſtake, not heeding what <hi>Juſtin</hi> meant by the name of ſacred Scripture. And thus he condemns the Jewiſh Rabbies for raſhly aſſerting that there was never any ſuch thing wrote by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive,</hi> but <hi>Behold a young Woman ſhall conceive.</hi> The whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie lies about the Tranſlation of the word <hi>Gnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> which the Seventy Interpreters Tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, <hi>puella,</hi> and after <hi>Aquila,</hi> the Jews of that Age. Which Interpretation nothing alters the Hebrew Text. But <hi>Juſtin</hi> allowing no Scripture but that which was publickly received for the uſe of the Church, that is, the Septuagint, oppoſes the Authority of that Tranſlation againſt the Jews. <hi>But you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in theſe things preſume to alter the expoſitions of your Fore-Fathers, who lived with</hi> Ptolomy <hi>King of</hi> Egypt, ſaying, <hi>that it is not ſo in the Scripture, as they tranſlated it, but behold a young Woman ſhall conceive,</hi> &amp;c. Now there, by Scripture is meant nothing but the verſion of <hi>Aquila,</hi> to which the Jews always adher'd in their diſputes with the Chriſtians. In like manner <hi>Juſtin</hi> accuſes the Jews to have eras'd out of their. Bibles theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>à ligno, from the wood, Pſal.</hi> 95. But if we conſider the matter more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, thoſe words ſeem rather to have been obtruded upon the place, then omitted. And therefore they muſt of neceſſity be deceived, who too unwarily follow <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyrs opinion, too peremptorily giving his Judgment upon things which he did not altogether ſo well underſtand. I ſhould for my
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50875:38"/>part rather hearken to <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, whom <hi>Juſtin</hi> brings in anſwering his Dialogue concerning the mutilation of the Scripture, done by the Princes of the Jews. <hi>The thing ſeems incredible; I ſay it ſeems to be incredible: it is more horrible then caſting the Molten Calf, or Children offered to Devils, or the killing of the Prophets themſelves.</hi> Certainly the Jews had ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for their Holy Bibles, which would not permit them to corrupt them on ſet purpoſe. Moreover by the anſwers of <hi>Trypho,</hi> which <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſupplies, it is apparent that the Jews at that time ſo zealouſly devoted to the letter of the Scriptures, and the ſubtleties of Allegories, adhered the more cloſely to the Hebrew Text, that they might the more vigorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them upon the Chriſtians. For which reaſon they made Greek Tranſlations, which might more truly correſpond with the Hebrew Text, then the Septuagint. For which reaſon <hi>Juſtin</hi> alſo many times praiſes as well the Jewiſh as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Verſion, to the end that diſputing with the Jews, he might convince them out of their own Books. Laſtly, there is no reaſon why the Jews ſhould be called in Queſtion for depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Copies of their Bibles, if they have tranſlated one and the ſame Hebrew word in that ſignification, which was moſt proper for their buſineſs; as when <hi>Juſtin</hi> in the ſame Dialogue objects againſt <hi>Trypho,</hi> that the Jews read the 49th of <hi>Geneſis</hi> amiſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

For the Hebrew Word <hi>Shilo,</hi> may be rightly rendered in either ſenſe, neither is it certain whether the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſo confidently avers to be that of the LXX Interpreters, was really theirs or no, whereas the Roman Edition owns that for the true one, which <hi>Juſtin</hi> attributes to the Jews, where the Scholiaſt obſerves that it is the ſame in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Euſebius, Chryſoſtom, Cyrill, Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> among the Latin Fathers.</p>

For there by the Scriptures <hi>Irenaeus</hi> means the Tranſlation of the LXX Interpreters, which was made uſe of in the Synagogues; which Tranſlation being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nativity of Chriſt, and made by the Jews, he blames from thence the Verſion of <hi>Aquila</hi> as naught and deceitful, and infers the propenſity of the Jews to deſtroy the Bible from that Tranſlation which they allow'd in hatred of the Chriſtian Faith, forſaking the Verſion of the Septuagint, which was compil'd by their own Country-men. So far was <hi>Irenaeus</hi> from aſſerting the Jews to have maim'd the Bible, that he rather confirms their entireneſs, and denies them to be really depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, only adding a conjecture of his own, of what might have been probable.

                        <hi>that Principle or Foundation is apparent, that the Jews corrupted both their own, and our Bibles in hatred of Chriſt and the Chriſtians, and ras'd ſome Books out of the Canon, was taken for granted by our moſt holy Fathers, and upon the confidence of that Foundation, they did ſometimes unfold ſeveral occurring difficulties, and anſwer'd the Objections of the Hereticks and Jews.</hi> But with the good leave of that moſt learned Man, I muſt needs ſay that he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Fathers in this matter, but only made uſe of what he had read in other Authors, and in the works of <hi>Leo Caſtro,</hi> a mortal Enemy of the Jews, and inſerted their words verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim into his Exercitations: Nor am I one who believe an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50875:40"/>obligation of ſtanding to the Opinion of the Fathers in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Their Authority is of great moment in matters of Faith, but in Critick Learning it is then to be eſteem'd, when it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with Truth; and for this we have the Authority of the Prince of the Latine Divines St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who as he was a man of a moſt acute Wit, and piercing Judgment, was not afraid to recede from the Opinion of other Fathers upon that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which is now the Subject of the Controverſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought it leſs probable. So that when he came to conſider the difference of the Greek and Hebrew Copies, in the years of <hi>Methuſalem</hi>'s Age, he could not favour their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who preferr'd the Greek before the Hebrew Copies. Though St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> readily acknowledges with the reſt of the Fathers, that work to be the work of the Prophets. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Opinion of ſome perſons of his Age in theſe words. <hi>They admit not that here might be a greater miſtake of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>

                        <hi>rather than that it ſhould be falſe in that Language, from whence the Scripture was tranſlated into our Language by the Greek; but they ſay it was not likely that the LXX Interpreters, who at one and the ſame time agreed in ſenſe, could err, or would impoſe a falſhood, where no Intereſt could ſway them. But the Jews, while they bear us ill will, becauſe the Law and the Prophets are become common with us by Interpretation, have made ſome alterations in their Copies to leſſen the Authority of ours. This Opinion, or rather Suſpition, let every one accept as he thinks good; but certain it is that</hi> Methuſelah <hi>liv'd after the Flood.</hi> Here St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeems to be guided rather by the weight of reaſon, than a cloud of Writers, who, as he well knew, did not make a right computation of <hi>Methuſelah</hi>'s Years. Wherefore handling the ſame Argument again, he openly affirms that he cannot agree with them who believ'd that the Jews had corrupted their Scripture of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He denies that the Jews, being a People ſcatter'd into all parts of the World, could joyn in ſuch an Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to a Falſhood that ſhould be never diſcover'd. At length he adds; <hi>I could never doubt but that it would be well done, that when there is any thing of variance found in both Copies, when there cannot be Truth in both, let the Truth be judged by that Language out of which the Tranſlation was made by the Interpreter.</hi> And that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſhould be of this Opinion contrary to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of almoſt all the Doctors of his Age, nothing but the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50875:40"/>Truth over-rul'd him. I wiſh that other with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> would rather conſider the things themſelves, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of others. For this Diverſity in Opinion might eaſily be reconcil'd. I paſs by the Teſtimony of other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of whoſe names <hi>Leo Caſtro</hi> gives us a long ſcroll to little purpoſe: for it will be ſufficient to produce them who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Hebrew Language. For it would be an idle thing to produce Witneſſes that know nothing of the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Among the Greeks, only <hi>Origen,</hi> among the Latines, only <hi>Jerom</hi> applied himſelf to the underſtanding of the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. For to omit all the reſt, <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> whom <hi>Jerom</hi> cryes up for his knowledge of five Languages, having a ſmattering of Hebrew, underſtood nothing of the Critical Learning. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſcrupl'd not to call <hi>Origen,</hi> next after the Apoſtles, Maſter of the Church, by reaſon of his ſingular Learning, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Scriptures; but if we ſeriouſly conſider <hi>Origens</hi> Hebraick Induſtry, we ſhall find him but meanly vers'd in that Language. But for that he is to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that graſping at many things, he ſometimes ſpeaks not ſo exactly, imitating <hi>Philo,</hi> and ſuch kind of Authors. But he was furniſhed with Hebrew Learning ſufficient to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the diſcrepancies of various Editions,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Origens</hi> Opinion concerning the Jewiſh Manuſcr. explained.</note> though he were inferiour to St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in that particular. Therefore his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Purity of the Hebrew Text, is not to be deſpis'd. Theſe Writers that promote the Jewiſh Copies, bring many Quotations out of <hi>Origen,</hi> by which they ſeem to traduce the Jews for being Corrupters of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Thus in reference to the words of <hi>Jeremy; The Sin of</hi> Juda <hi>is written with an iron Pen,</hi> he argues the Jews to have plainly falſify'd, who tranſlate the words <hi>their Sin,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Sin of</hi> Judah. Again in the Epiſtle which he wrote to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican,</hi> concerning the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> he aſſerts that the Jews have cut off many paſſages from their Bibles, leſt they ſhould be read by the <hi>Plebeians.</hi> We muſt ſay, that as to thoſe things which contained the Reproach of Elders, Magiſtrates, and Judges, they took away as much as they could from the knowledge of the people, which are kept among their <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> And as an example of that Corruption, he brings what the Author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews relates of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and affirms that the words there written concerning
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50875:41"/>the Prophets, <hi>they were ſtoned, they were ſawed, and put to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deaths,</hi> are not in the publiſh'd Bibles: but that the words concerning <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s being cut in two with a Saw, were taken by Tradition, and preſerved in ſome ſecret place. <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was craftily, &amp; of ſet purpoſe done perhaps by the Jews, ſome unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent words being inſerted into Scripture, to abrogate the belief of the whole.</hi> Other Examples he adds, but of the ſame kind, in the ſame place, and all to prove the ſame thing; which Chriſt in the New Teſtament objects to the Jews, as being taken out of the Old, yet are not there to be found. Such are the words, <hi>Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, who ſleweſt the Prophets, and ſtonedſt them who were ſent unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame ſtory is related of <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> ſlain between the Temple and the Altar, which becauſe they do not appear in Scripture, he therefore ſuſpects to have been taken out by the Rabbies. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there was nothing more which the Seers, and Princes, and Elders of the People more deſir'd, then to blot out thoſe paſſages which contained their miſdeeds among the People. And therefore it is no wonder, that they who were not much unlike thoſe Elders in their practices, ſhould ſteal, and remove out of the Scriptures the true Story of</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna, <hi>againſt whom the laſcivious Elders laid their unjuſt Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other Examples might be heaped together out of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> Works, to prove the ſame thing; which many Writers abuſe, to ſubvert the Hebrew Text; not underſtanding <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> genius, and his proper method of writing.

And this, <hi>Jerom</hi> long before had obſerv'd not only of <hi>Origen,</hi> but of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, Methodius,</hi> and <hi>Appollinarius, who ſometimes ſpeak not what they think, but what is neceſſary.</hi> That too much liberty of <hi>Origen</hi> was the reaſon, that when he prattl'd without judgment whatever he had drawn out of other Authors, he was looked upon as a Heretick for delivering the Opinions of others as his own thoughts. Theſe things are therefore diligently to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if you would reconcile <hi>Origen</hi> to <hi>Origen,</hi> never to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude for <hi>Origens</hi> what he wrote only upon probability, proper for the Times and the Perſons to whom he applied himſelf.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50875:41"/>controverſie concerning the purity of the Hebrew Text, it is no difficult thing to make out: For the ſame <hi>Origen,</hi> who never ſpeaks well of the Jews, as corrupters of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is cited by <hi>Jerom</hi> for a moſt eager defender of the Hebrew truth. <hi>But if any one ſhall ſay,</hi> ſaith Jerom, <hi>that the Hebrew Bibles were afterwards falſified by the Jews,</hi>

But if they ſhall ſay that the Bibles were falſified after the coming of our Lord &amp; Saviour, and the preaching of the Apoſtles, I cannot but laugh that our Saviour, the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, ſhould produce Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, how the Jews would afterwards falſify.</hi> Here <hi>Origen</hi> does not play faſt and looſe, but freely and plainly delivers his opinion what he thinks of the Jews. But why the ſame <hi>Origen</hi> ſometimes affirms the Contrary, the ſame St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who well underſtood his humour, teaches us in theſe words.<note place="margin">Prooem.

                     <p>Were theſe and other things, which in prudence I omit, but rightly obſerved, in reference to <hi>Origens</hi> Genius and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing, it might be eaſily diſcerned, how he came to be induced to tax the Jews of falſifying Scripture. For in his Homilies to the people he was bound to act the part of a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar perſon, and ſo in his epiſtle which he wrote to <hi>Africanus,</hi> he followed the opinion of the Ancient Fathers, concerning the Hebrew and Greek Copies; not daring to depart from it, leſt he might ſeem to joyn with the Jews, as by the words in the ſame Epiſtle he plainly intimates: <hi>Take care therefore leſt through imprudence and ignorance we abrogate thoſe exemplars, which are received in the Churches, and give an ill example to the Fraternity, to lay aſide thoſe ſacred books which are frequent among them, and give credit to the Hebrew Copies, as thoſe wherein there is nothing of miſtake.</hi> Then he calls to mind what a dammage it would be to Chriſtianity, to favour the Opinion of the Jews concerning the Tranſlation of the Septuagint. Upon which occaſion he farther adds; <hi>Conſider whether it be not good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what is written, Thou ſhalt not remove the Eternal bounds, which thy Anceſtors have appointed. Theſe things I ſay, not that I fear to ſearch the Jewiſh Scriptures, and to compare theirs with ours, and to ſee where they differ; for if it be not arrogancy to ſay ſo much, we have done to the utmoſt of our power, to exerciſe our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in all Editions and their differences, at what time we more ſedulouſly examined the Interpretation of the Septuagint, leſt we might ſeem to have introduc'd any thing of falſe and Adulterate, into the Churches under Heaven, and ſhould give an occaſion to thoſe who ſeek a pretence to calumniate thoſe which are in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, and to accuſe thoſe which are commonly uſed.</hi> By which it is manifeſt that <hi>Origen</hi> did not entirely approve the Opinion then vulgarly received concerning the Jewiſh Copies, but only for Government and convenience ſake; in regard that among the Learned he taught the quite contrary, nor does he ſeem much to value the Reaſons which he produces in his Epiſtle. For he adds a conjectural expreſſion, as it were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Which perhaps,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was done by craft on ſet purpoſe by the Jews.</hi> To all which we may add that the probations of theſe things, which he produces, are very ſhallow, and full of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; neither do I believe him to be the Author of them. But as he was a man of unexhauſted reading, he only quoted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50875:42"/>what he had read in other Authors. For how highly he valued the Jews, <hi>Origen</hi> openly teſtifies, when he made uſe of them as his inſtructors in the Hebrew Language, and by frequent diſcourſe and converſation with them, far exceeded all the other Doctors of the Church in the knowledge of the Scriptures.</p>

                     <p>Having thus diſplay'd St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Genius, and his method of Writing, let us come to our purpoſe. <hi>Johannes Morinus,</hi> who not unfrequently contradicts himſelf, ſeems to reproach the Inconſtancy of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in reference to the preſent Argument in theſe words.<note place="margin">in Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Bib.</note> Jerom <hi>in his Youth lookt upon the Tranſlation of the LXX Interpreters as approv'd by Chriſt and his Apostles—at length he accus'd the Jews of envious corrupting the Bible in hatred of the Christians. But being grown in years, and uſing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſeveral Rabbies, for the attaining the Hebrew Language, he ſo chang'd his Opinion, that he not only aſſerted the Hebrew Copies to be free from all Mutilation, but ſhew'd himſelf moſt violent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending his Aſſertion.</hi> But <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf makes anſwer to <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and others, who objected the ſame things againſt him, that he was no ſuch fool to forget in his Old Age what he had learnt in his Youth; nor do we ſo invent Novelties as to deſtroy old things. We are therefore firſt to conſider what has been already obſerv'd concerning St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s method of Writing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> being bred up in the Church, had the Bible in great honour, and tranſlated the Holy Writings corrected by moſt Antient Copies into his own Language, which was the Latine. Wherefore having embraced the vulgarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Opinion of their Authentickneſs, he cry'd out their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as others did, for ſo many Prophets, that thereby he might perſuade men to read them the more diligently, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50875:43"/>with the greater veneration. But whether they were to be in the Catalogue of Prophets or Interpreters, that he minded not, as not making for his purpoſe, being ſatisfied with report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was in every bodies mouth, for the promotion of his labour. But being grown older, after he had ſtudied the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language, acting the Critick, he no longer ſpoke from other mens mouths, but confidently aſſerted his own Opinions. At length when he had brought upon himſelf the ill-will of many, he again embrac'd the common Opinion concerning the Greek and Hebrew Copies, only for orders ſake, and with reſpect to his own Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I had rather adhere to St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his riper years, and now grown a skilful Critick, than when he was young, and only ſpake the thoughts of other men. Nor is it of any moment what <hi>Morinus</hi> Objects, that in theſe places St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems to ſpeak his own Sentiments, and not the Opinion of others. For it is familiar with St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to aſſert what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces only upon probability, and as the Opinion of others, as if he were affirming his own Judgment of the matter. In which ſenſe are to be underſtood the words of that Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he teſtifies,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Epiſt.</hi>
                        </note> that there are ſome things in the Hebrew Copies perverſely obliterated by the Jews. For there he ſpeaks the Opinion of thoſe Writers whom he had prais'd in his Preface. Thus he anſwers <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in another place, loading his Doctrine with reproaches. <hi>I in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>have ſo followed</hi> Origen, Dydimus, <hi>and</hi> Apollinarius, <hi>whoſe Opinions are certainly contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I might not forego the Truth of my Faith. What labour has been beſtowed upon the Commentaries, the progreſs of what I have ſaid will declare.</hi> And ſoon after, <hi>ſince that he ſhall be thought guilty of differing Interpretation, and contradictory Senſe, who in one and the ſame Work inſerts down the Expoſitions of many.</hi> Upon the ſame account, in anſwer to a Letter of St. <hi>Austins,</hi> after he had enumerated thoſe Doctors, whoſe words he had made uſe of in his own Works, he adds, <hi>Therefore, that I may ingeniouſly confeſs, I have read all theſe Authors, and heaping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the moſt of their Sentences in my mind, I call'd an</hi> Amanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis, <hi>and dictated either my own, or other mens, minding neither order nor words, nor ſometimes the ſenſe.</hi> In another place wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> again, <hi>If therefore you have thought any thing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50875:44"/>worthy reproof in our Explanation, it became your Learning to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether thoſe things which we wrote were in the Greek Authors, that if they had not ſaid them, you might condemn my Opinion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially having frankly confeſſed in my Preface, that I followed the Commentaries of</hi> Origen, <hi>and dictated either my own, or other mens.</hi> However, leſt any one ſhould object againſt him, that this manner of Writing was peculiar to him, he informs us in another place whom he propos'd to himſelf to imitate. <hi>Read,</hi> ſays he, Demoſthenes, <hi>read</hi> Tully, <hi>and leſt thoſe Orators ſhould diſpleaſe, who ſpeak things rather probable than true, read</hi> Plato, Theophraſtus, Xenophon, Ariſtotle, <hi>&amp;c. Nay, he praiſes</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Methodius, Euſebius, Apollinarius, Minutius, Victorinus Lactantius, Hilarius, <hi>who imitated the ſame manner of writing, and at laſt after all he adds St.</hi> Paul; <hi>read, ſays he, his Epiſtles chiefly to the</hi> Romans, <hi>the</hi> Galathians, <hi>the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>wherein he ſeems to be Polemick altogether, and there you ſhall ſee by his Teſtimonies, taken out of the New Teſtament, how prudently he diſſembles his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Which paſſages I have the more prolixly quoted out of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> becauſe I find many things attributed to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> which never came into his thoughts. Firſt therefore the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> writing is to be obſerved, before Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given of his meaning, or that any thing which goes under his name and authority be oppoſed. For frequently he writes not his own ſentiments, but what he has collected from others. Which if they be rightly underſtood, St. <hi>Jerome</hi> will never be found to differ from himſelf, not ſo much as in this very ſubject which we handle at preſent. Therefore in his Commentaries upon <hi>Michah,</hi> he durſt not openly accuſe the Jews, as if they had obliterated the words <hi>Ephrata,</hi> or <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in hatred of the Chriſtian Religion, leſt he ſhould be thought to be born of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> But this he declares to be the Opinion of ſome of the Doctors of his time, affirming no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, only reporting the repugnant Opinions of others. Yet <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> greedily lays hold upon this Opinion of <hi>Jerom,</hi> a perſon otherwiſe learned, to ſhew that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> durſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that the Jews had purpoſely obliterated the word <hi>Ephrata</hi> out of their Copies. But it is no difficult thing to apprehend what St. <hi>Jerom</hi> thought of this Argument, while he ſhews himſelf ſo ſtrenuous a Champion of the Hebrew Text, which he frequently calls the Hebrew truth.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Opinion of <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> concerning the Hebrew Manuſcripts is examined and refuted.</head>
                     <p>THat the Scriptures of the Jews, are the only true and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Scriptures, is the Common Opinion of all the Divines whom we call Proteſtants, who in their diſputes with the Catholick Doctors always have recourſe to the Hebrew Roots, if the Latin Interpreter will not ſerve their turn, who, as they believe has miſtaken in many things. Hence it comes to paſs, that thoſe Divines who call themſelves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, make no reckoning of the Ancient Tranſlations of the Church; ſome very few excepted who have diſcerned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Blemiſhes in the Hebrew context, as well as in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of it. But <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> taking a farther leap, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted at a greater diſtance from the received cuſtoms of the Proteſtants, and openly accuſes the Jews of <hi>Falſification,</hi> as if they had expung'd ſeveral things out of their Scriptures in hatred of the Chriſtians of ſet purpoſe, and that after the coming of Chriſt and the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> More than that, he ſharply rebukes thoſe that plead the Jews cauſe, and as for the Doctors of their ſect, who defend the modern reading of the Hebrew Scripture, he calls them,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Andr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</note> 
                        <hi>Aſſes void of ſight and underſtanding, clad with the Profeſſors Gown, and carrying for their ſhield the Maſoretick Bible with all its points.</hi> Now who would not think but that <hi>Voſſius</hi> had moſt impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable reaſon for ſuch a bold aſſertion and challenge? But how groſsly he has impoſed upon the World, ſhall appear by that which follows. <hi>What place is there,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which treats of the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>in ſacred Scripture, which they have not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured either to corrupt, or to enervate by ſiniſter Interpretation?</hi> And a little after; <hi>When they perceived that the time of the</hi> Meſſiah's <hi>coming was paſt;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Diſſertat. de Sept. Praefat.</note> 
                        <hi>for it was then full ſix thouſand years from the Creation of the World, that they might gain</hi> 2000 <hi>years, they expung'd the whole fourteen Ages out of their Scriptures: And
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50875:45"/>to obliterate the remaining five or ſix Ages, they curtail'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of the Judges, omitting Anarchies, and contracting the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Perſian Kings. By which means they fin'd the meaſure of time full two thouſand years.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Voſſius</hi> blam'd.</note> But theſe are the meer Inventions of <hi>Voſſius,</hi> who not only accuſes the Jews, but impeaches the <hi>Samaritans</hi> for the ſame fact, tho upon another account: Nevertheleſs the Ancient Fathers of the Church, <hi>Africanus, Origen, Euſebius, Jerom, Auſtin</hi> and others, who took notice of this difference of the Jewiſh Codex from the Hebrew Exemplars in Chronology, never thought of laying this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation to the Jews charge. Nay St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aſſerts that the Hebrew Exemplar is to be preferred before the Greek, and is of that Opinion, that credit ſhould be given to that Language, out of which the Interpretation is made into another. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who, diſputing againſt <hi>Trypho,</hi> teazes the Jews in various manners to vindicate the Greek Interpretation of the LXX, which was then of ſole repute in the Church, ſpeaks not a word of any Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, by them altered to ſupport their cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, had the Jews bethought themſelves of corrupting the Hebrew Scriptures, leſt the time of the <hi>Meſſiah's</hi> coming might ſeem to be elaps'd, with much more advantage they might have obliterated the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which points out the time exactly, then the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Judges.</hi> But that the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which for the moſt part refers to the time of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> remains entire, is confeſs'd by all; and <hi>Voſſius</hi> cannot deny, but that the Jews are hard put to it by this Prophecy. But to ward off the blow, he affirms that the Ancient Jews did not only ſeparate <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Chorus of the Prophets, but alſo denyed him to be a Prophet. But the learned perſon never underſtood the reaſon why, or in what ſence the Jews did ſeparate him from the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. However concerning this matter the Chriſtians in vain diſpute with the Jews. For both willingly acknowledge that in the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> there are many Propheſies of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> to come, and that that Book was written by divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the other Books of Scripture were. The Jews alſo feign the ſame things of <hi>David</hi> as of <hi>Daniel;</hi> however they do not deprive him of holy inſpiration: Quite the contrary, they publickly aſſert that there are many things in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:50875:45"/>which foretel the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> ſo that if there be any difference in this particular between them and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the controverſie is meerly about the name, as has been already prov'd, in regard they otherwiſe methodize the Books of Scripture than the Chriſtians. But <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſtabs himſelf with his own Sword, while he goes about to prove the Jews guilty of falſifying their Chronologie, in regard the modern Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie of the Hebrew Text preſſes harder upon the Jews, then that which is drawn out of the verſion of the LXX Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters; nor do the Jews deny in their Talmudick Books but that the time is fulfilled and paſt within which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was expected, but they add, that their own ſins retard his coming. Theſe are the words of the Talmudiſts.<note place="margin">Talm. in Tract. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed. &amp; in Avoda Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</note> 
                        <hi>This is the Tradition of the Houſe of</hi> Elia: <hi>The World ſhall conſiſt of ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. Two thouſand ſhall be of emptineſs, that is, before the Law. Two thouſand ſhall be ſpent under the Law. And two thouſand years the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>ſhall reign. But by reaſon of our iniquities, thoſe years are already elaps'd.</hi> Voſſius endeavouring to draw this Tradition of <hi>Elias</hi> to his purpoſe, has err'd in many places. For firſt he ſeems to applaud it, as being delivered by <hi>Elia</hi> the Prophet, or taken out of his Book, <hi>which formerly as he ſays, was numbered among the Books of the New Teſtament.</hi> But this <hi>Elias</hi> was a Talmudick Doctor, like <hi>Rabbi Hillell,</hi> R. <hi>Schammai,</hi> R. <hi>Johanan</hi> and ſeveral others whoſe names are ſet down in the Talmud. Then it is a fiction to ſay that the 2000 years that preceded the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ought not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered from the beginning of the Creation, but from the Flood, or from that time that God told <hi>Noah,</hi> that he would deſtroy the World. For the Opinion of the Jews concerning the ſix thouſand years Duration of the World, according to the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of R. <hi>Elias,</hi> is in this place far different. For the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Propheſie is deriv'd from the ſix days of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for that as God created the World in ſix days, ſo the ſame World ſhould endure ſix thouſand years: So that the computation of the years of the World muſt be taken from the firſt Creation of all things. The Commentators upon the Talmud reckon two thouſand years from the firſt man crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the time that <hi>Abraham,</hi> abandoning the worſhip of Idols, embrac'd the true Religion of one God.<note place="margin">Diſſertat. de Sept. Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.</note> At what time according to their computation, he was two and Fifty years
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50875:46"/>of Age. But thoſe are frigid Arguments which <hi>Voſsius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to prove out of the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that the beginning of the World is to be reckon'd from the Flood, becauſe the Apoſtle call'd that the Old World which preceded; and the Earth which we now inhabit the other World. I ſay theſe are very ſorry Arguments, and quite from the purpoſe. But enough of <hi>Elia</hi>'s Prophecy concerning the duration of the World: Nor is there any heed to be given to that Book of the Prophecies of <hi>Elias,</hi> which <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> cajoll'd by the name of <hi>Elias</hi> the Talmudiſt, believes to have been receiv'd into the number of Canonical Books. Now let us examine his other proofs brought againſt the Jews, whether they be of any more moment.</p>
                     <p>In the next place <hi>Voſſius</hi> brings a load of Arguments to prove that the Jews have mutilated not a few Texts of Scripture, and firſt he calls <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> for a Witneſs, who writes that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Exemplars were corrupted by the Jews. But as to what may be borrowed from <hi>Juſtin,</hi> we have already made a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary anſwer. <hi>Juſtin</hi> never conſulted the Hebrew Text, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he; as being one that underſtood not the Language, as is manifeſt out of his own Writings. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith <hi>Voſſius, how bravely had the holy Martyr foil'd</hi> Trypho, <hi>and the reſt of the Jews with whom he liv'd, had not thoſe Crimes been true that were laid to their charge?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Voſſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> But this way of arguing does not become a Learned man, who, in peruſing <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Books, might eaſily have perceiv'd that he had miſtaken in many things. But <hi>Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> goes on; <hi>The Prophecy of Chriſt which occurs</hi> Pſal. 22.16. <hi>where inſtead of</hi> they digg'd, as a Lion <hi>is put in the room, moſt of the Chriſtians, except Phanaticks and Semi-Jews, acknowledge to have been deprav'd by the Rabbies.</hi> True it is indeed, that the Jews are call'd in queſtion by moſt Divines, for having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely corrupted this place. But, far be it from me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe people <hi>Phanaticks</hi> or <hi>Semi-Jews,</hi> who clear the Jews of this offence; when <hi>Rabbi Jacob Ben Hajim,</hi> Reſtorer of the <hi>Maſora</hi> publickly teſtifies, that in ſome Manuſcripts of the Hebrews he has met with <hi>Caru, they digg'd,</hi> or pierc'd, which is in favour of the Chriſtians. Nor is it a wonder that the Maſorites choſe that reading <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>as a Lion,</hi> which was moſt for their purpoſe. I acknowledge the Tranſlation of the Greeks and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to be the truer; yet the Jews are not to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50875:46"/>be accus'd of falſification for having made choice, out of two Readings, of that which was moſt for their turn. In the words <hi>Cari</hi> and <hi>Carou,</hi> all underſtanding Criticks know there is but little difference, and how eaſily and frequently the change of <hi>Jod</hi> for <hi>Vau,</hi> and <hi>Vau</hi> for <hi>Jod</hi> happens. Beſides that, there are ſeveral other Examples of the redundancy of the Letter <hi>Aleph,</hi> which were not unknown to the Mazoreths; ſo that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Aleph</hi> may as well fall out to be ſuperfluous in <hi>Carou,</hi> as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in <hi>Cari.</hi> Wherefore the Greek Interpreters and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> paſt it by as ridiculous, or elſe perhaps it might not be in their Copies; but the Maſorites, who acknowledge it, made uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Vain are alſo thoſe things which <hi>Voſſius</hi> alledges out of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary, c.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 10. as if the Jews had purpoſely chang'd the Antient Reading, which the Old Interpreters found in their Copies. But there is no skilful Critick but will diſcern that this diverſity happen'd from the varaince in ſeveral Copies, while in ſome it is read <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>they have pierced,</hi> in other <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>they have danced,</hi> by reaſon of the eaſie tranſmutation of <hi>Reſch</hi> into <hi>Daleth,</hi> and <hi>Daleth</hi> into <hi>Reſch:</hi> Nor do I ſee any reaſon why for that, or five hundred more of the ſame ſort, the Jews ſhould be more accus'd of Falſification than the Greek or Latine Scribes, or of whatſoever other Nation, who make frequent miſtakes in their Tranſcriptions. This change of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo alike in ſhape, cannot be avoided ſometimes in any Language, whence afterwards ariſes that vaſt difference in Manuſcripts. In which particular let <hi>Scioppius</hi>'s little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Art of Criticiſm be conſulted, who perfectly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates all theſe difficulties. <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> alſo a great peruſer of Manuſcripts, has cited ſeveral places to confirm this Aſſertion.</p>

                        </gap>, as the Seventy Interpreters ſeem to have read it, the Jews are not therefore to be accus'd of Falſification, becauſe they retain'd <hi>Jod</hi> in their Exemplars. And it may be probable alſo that the Greek Interpreters read it in their Exemplar, when the ſenſe is the ſame whether it be pronounced with a <hi>Jod,</hi> or without one; for that <hi>Jod</hi> is as often pronounc'd like an <hi>e</hi> as an <hi>i.</hi> But the Maſorites, who conjectur'd that it was to be read <hi>Schilo,</hi> retain'd the Antient <hi>Jod,</hi> which does not hinder but that with the Greek Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we may now read <hi>Schelo,</hi> as ſome of the Rabbies do. Theſe things <hi>Voſſius</hi> ought not to have been ignorant of, that ſo often impeaches the Jews, and farther writes, that they who deny this place to have been corrupted by the Jews, obliterate ſame both before and after the coming of Chriſt. Nor is there any reaſon, if there were any depravations before the coming of Chriſt, why <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſhould attribute them to the careleſneſs of the Scribes; and as for thoſe which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded into the Hebrew Exemplars after the coming of Chriſt,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50875:48"/>why he ſhould aſcribe them to the wickedneſs and malice of the Jews. <hi>Voſſius</hi> too much detracts from the Maſorites of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias,</hi> when he calls them Barbarians and Strangers to their Native Language, from whom nothing could proceed but what was vicious, and void of reaſon. For with <hi>Voſſius</hi> I readily grant them to have been no Prophets, nor do I doubt but that they were the firſt Inventors of pointed Vowels and Tittles. But from thence to infer that they were Barbarians,<note place="margin">De Scriptur. Interprit. c. <hi>30.</hi>
                        </note> and unskill'd in the Hebrew Language, and that the Scriptures were burden'd rather than adorn'd with pointed Vowels and Tittles, was a piece of extravagance. If thoſe things are true which <hi>Voſſius</hi> boaſts of himſelf, that he had ſeen above two thouſand Hebrew Manuſcripts, it is not probable that he was altogether ignorant of the Maſoretick Art. That was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Jews of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> who aſcertain'd the Reading of the Hebrew Text, as it was then publickly in practice by the aſſiſtance of Points. It was call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d the <hi>Maſora,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Tradition or Method of Reading the Hebrew Text approv'd by long uſe. The ſame Judgment ought to be given concerning their Criticks, and of the Greek and Latine Books examin'd and corrected by Learned men. The Doctors of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias</hi> were the Maſters of the moſt famous Academy among the Jews, who collecting the Exemplars and Copies of the Bible from all parts, publiſh'd an Accurate Edition out of all together. Nothing was here done by them that deſerv'd to be blam'd or upbraided. And beſides, this correction of theirs was no hindrance to others, but that they might examine the ſame Exemplars again; and I believe the ſame Exemplars may be re-examin'd in our Age, according to the Greek Verſion of the Septuagint, and the Latine Tranſlation of St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> in ſuch places where it ſhall appear, that their Copies differed from the <hi>Maſoreticks.</hi> However, we will not accuſe the Jews of Falſification, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> does, becauſe their Manuſcripts were not the ſame with thoſe, which the Greek Interpreters made uſe of in their Tranſlation: But we muſt ſay this, that various Readings are no leſs to be found in the Hebrew Exemplars, than in the Copies of the Greeks and Latines, and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Voſſius</hi> believes there can be nothing of ſolidity in the Traditions of the Rabbies,<note place="margin">Reſponſ. ad nuper. Critic.</note> that are only propagated by the Ear; <hi>And ſuch Traditions,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which are only propagated by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50875:49"/>the Ear,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">He is refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                        <hi>ſeldom out-laſt above two or three Ages.</hi> But what does this concern that Tradition, which is now in diſpute? There is no Controverſie about the Oral Traditions of the Jews, which he acknowledges to be deſervedly exploded by the more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but only about the Maſora, which the verry <hi>Carraites,</hi> who condemn the greateſt part of the Jewiſh Traditions as Old Womens Fables, have however cordially embrac'd. If <hi>Voſſius</hi> rejects this, he muſt of neceſſity reject the Lection of the Chaldee, Syriack, and Hebraick, which have nothing of Antiquity. For to all theſe, in like manner as to the Hebrew, are added pointed Vowels, which make their Lection certain. <hi>But that Text,</hi> ſaith <hi>Voſſius, is mute, which no man knows how to read or underſtand, as being defective in one half part, nor fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with other Vowels than the Enemies of Chriſt have added.</hi> Was the ſame Codex or Text leſs defective in the days of the LXX Interpreters, when there appear'd no pointed Vowels at all in it? Such is the nature of the Hebrew Tongue, as of all the other Eaſtern Languages, that it makes a ſhew of the feweſt Vowels. So that the Reading of thoſe Books which are Printed in the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> does not a little depend upon uſe, which as the Jews do, we here call Tradition, or the Maſora. Now from whom could that uſe of Reading the Hebrew Text be borrowed but from the Jews? <hi>But,</hi> ſays <hi>Voſſius, They are Enemies of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> Have they therefore forgot to read their own Books, becauſe Jews? Certainly, unleſs they were Jews, they would never read the Hebrew Text in their Synagogues. Neither could the Reading of the Books be derived by any other means to the Chriſtians. Beſides, the Seventy Interpreters were Jews, upon whom <hi>Voſſius</hi> altogether depends, and they followed no other Lection of the Hebrew Text, than what was receiv'd among the Jews by the publick practice of thoſe times. So that all the obloquy that <hi>Voſſius</hi> throws upon the Hebrew Text, that it is defective in the half part, may be affirm'd of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Codex, which the LXX Interpreters made uſe of: Nor ought the Text ſo much to be accus'd, as the Idiom of the Hebrew Language; and upon that account all the Eaſtern Languages may be accus'd for half Languages. Nevertheleſs <hi>Voſſius</hi> inculcates it over again, even to loathſomneſs, that the Hebrew Text is mute, and by the acknowledgment of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50875:49"/>Rabbins, a half Language, as being deſtitute of true vowels. But what were the true ancient vowels of the Hebrew Text, he confeſſes he does not underſtand, while he ſo confidently avers the Language to be deſtitute of them. Yet as he himſelf makes no queſtion, the Ancient Hebrew Vowels are <hi>Aleph, He, Van,</hi> and <hi>Jod.</hi> To which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> makes an Addition of others. But becauſe the Eaſtern people rarely made uſe of them in writing, the Criticks invented pointed vowels, for the more quick and eaſie reading of the Scriptures. But <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſpeaks very uncoheringly, not ſo much as to the truth of the buſineſs, as out of a preconceived prejudice againſt the Jews.</p>

In our Age <hi>Johannes Morinus</hi> in his exercitations with which he has adorned the Hebrew Pentateuch, Hortinger in his Antimorinian, Exercitations, <hi>Walton</hi> in his Prolegomena to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Text, and other moſt learned men have illuſtrated the <hi>Samaritan</hi> affairs, and therefore paſſing by thoſe things in ſilence, I proceed to their Texts, of which ſome of the Fathers as well Greek as Latin have made mention, together with the Scholiaſt of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Frankfurt</hi> Editions of the Septuagint. That the ſect of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> makes only uſe of the Pentateuch of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſuppoſe is known to all. For at what time they revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Jews, there was one Law among all the Hebrews, the other Books of Scripture, not being yet compos'd,<note place="margin">The Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Texts.</note> or if they were, not yet made publick. But what to think of that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> Copy, is a thing difficult to reſolve. <hi>Morinus,</hi> who was the firſt that publiſhed it, laſhing out into the praiſe of it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Cuſtom extols it to the skies. For which reaſon he is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50875:50"/>much blam'd by the learned: Eſpecially by <hi>Muiſius,</hi> then Royal profeſſor of Hebrew at <hi>Paris;</hi> who very ſeverely Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizes <hi>Morinus</hi>'s opinion of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Pentateuch. After that Hottinger ſet forth his exercitations upon the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Pentateuch in oppoſition to <hi>Morinus.</hi> And both reprove a great many things in him, which he does not ſeem to aſſert, he having only praiſed a little more than needed the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Text, which was then the ſubject of his diſcourſe, after which manner prefacing upon his Edition of the Greek Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he wonderfully upbraids the Hebrew Text. The moſt moderate of all are <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> and <hi>Brian Walton,</hi> who in many things do not reject the credit of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch. But of all others <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> has the worſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it, who affirms that the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Text was of ſet purpoſe, and in many places new dreſſed and corrupted by one <hi>Doſitheus,</hi> a certain <hi>Samaritan</hi> Heretick.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Codex is one and the ſame with the Hebrew, only few little variances excepted, as is obſerved as well by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Chronicles, and by St. <hi>Jerom. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Jerom,</hi>

Which words of St. <hi>Jerom Joſeph Scaliger</hi> ſeems not to have underſtood, when he affirms, that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> read the Pentateuch with juſt as many Letters as the Jews, neither more or leſs. For St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf ſometimes obſerves the various reading of both Codex's; as in his Hebrew Queſtions upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and his Commentaries upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> wherefore St. <hi>Jerom</hi> when he affirms the Jewiſh and <hi>Samaritan</hi> Exemplars to be alike in all things, intended only by thoſe Words to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Codex from the Greek and Latin Tranſlations; In regard the firſt is the pure and ſimple Hebrew context, which cannot be ſaid of the Greek and Latin Bibles. In the ſame manner ſpeaks <hi>Euſebius,</hi> upon whom St. <hi>Jerom</hi> altogether depends. That the <hi>Samaritan</hi> differs from the Hebrew Pentateuch, in ſome things, is paſt all diſpute, as may appear by the Pariſian, and Engliſh Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glottons in Print. Which Copy the noble <hi>Peter à Valle,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the <hi>Samaritans:</hi> And afterward <hi>Achilles Harlay Sancy,</hi> the Kings Embaſſador in <hi>Turkey,</hi> caus'd to be brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> and laid up in the Library of the Fathers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50875:50"/>of the Oratory near the <hi>Loure.</hi> And that there are other Copies of the ſame Pentateuch in other Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Epiſtles of <hi>Pereſcius, Peter, à Valle, Comberus,</hi> and <hi>Aleander</hi> to <hi>Morinus,</hi> apparently Teſtifie. <hi>Jerom Alean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> thus wrote in the year 1628. I would have you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there is here in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library another <hi>Samaritan</hi> Copy of the Pentateuch, written in the ſame <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> Letters, which <hi>Scipio,</hi> of Pious Memory, Cardinal of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi> then Library-keeper bought for 300 Crowns. Which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, though it be written in Hebrew Characters, yet is it in the Hebrew Language like to ours. Certain it is that the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> though they were much inferiour in number to the Jews, yet after the Deſtruction of their Temple at <hi>Gerizim,</hi> retained the Cuſtoms and Ceremonies of their Country, and read the Pentateuch of <hi>Moſes</hi> in their Synagogues, as they do at this day. The Samaritan Copy which is come to our hands, being examin'd by the Fragments of the Antient Exemplars, which are extant in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and the reſt of the Fathers, ſeems to be a true and perfect Copy, and the ſame with thoſe that were read in the Antient Times by the Samaritans. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will not deny but that it is degenerated in ſome things from its Original Purity and Sincerity. But this is the fate of all Books, which are not however to be therefore rejected for illegitimate Birth, becauſe they do not exactly agree with the Originals in all things. For then we could not ſay that any one of the Antient Authors were come perfect to our hands; nor were <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verſes, ſo common now-a-days, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for his, becauſe the moſt Critical of men <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> quotes ſomethings out of <hi>Homer,</hi> which are not to be found in our Modern Copies. Nor were the Jewiſh Copies of the Bibles now in uſe to be entertain'd, becauſe they do not exactly agree with thoſe which the Seventy Interpreters made uſe of in their Tranſlations. We muſt therefore aſſert, that the Copies of the Samaritan and Jewiſh Pentateuch, are real and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Copies, though there may be ſome difference between them;<note place="margin">Objections againſt the Purity of the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</note> as <hi>Ariſtotles Homer</hi> plainly appears to be the ſame <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> which was examin'd by <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> although they do agree in all things.</p>
                     <p>However, there were not wanting ſome, eſpecially among the Proteſtants, who thought the Codex of the Samaritans to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50875:51"/>be rejected, led thereto chiefly by this reaſon, becauſe the true Worſhip of God, the Succeſſion of the Prieſts and Doctors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd only among the Hebrews, not among the Samaritans, and therefore the Copies of the Law were to be taken from them alone, as being the true People of God. But I wonder, that the Proteſtant Divines, who make ſo ſlight of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, and the Succeſſion of Prieſts and Doctors, ſhould enforce theſe Arguments. For in this particular, the Authority of the Church is not greater than of the Synagogue. Who can be ignorant that the Authority of the Church has not been able to make good the Purity of its own Exemplars, or to juſtifie them from being clear from all manner of faults, when the Verſion of the Seventy Interpreters, of which the Eaſtern and Weſtern Church made uſe, has not been entire from the very time of <hi>Origen?</hi> However, I readily grant that the Hebrew Exemplar is to be chiefly preferr'd, for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians borrow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There are alſo other faults with which the defenders of the Hebrew Text load the Samaritan Copies: For firſt they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endeavour to prove it mutilated by the Example of ſome few words, and then they ſay, that ſome words are foiſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of others. They alſo object the differences of the Hebrew and Samaritan Texts one with another; as alſo the careleſneſs of the Scribes, who confound the Letters <hi>Aleph</hi> and <hi>Ain, He</hi> and <hi>Heth,</hi> and other Letters reſembling in form. But they kill themſelves with their own weapons, when the ſame things may be objected againſt the Hebrew Texts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In this the Patrons of the Jewiſh Text are deceived,<note place="margin">The Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan text vindicated.</note> becauſe that out of a preconceiv'd Opinion of ſome of the Jews, they think it to be free from all Errour; which is to be only affirm'd of the Originals. We have already ſhew'd you that the manner of writing of the Hebrew Context, was very inconſtant, and perhaps more free than among the Samaritans, who never hunted after the Trifles of Jewiſh Allegories. Even in this the Samaritan Codex's excel the Jewiſh, for that many things which Superſtition foiſted into the one, are wanting in the other. To this we may add, that the Hand and Character
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50875:51"/>of the Samaritan Text plainly proves Antiquity. On the other ſide, the Jewiſh Manuſcripts being reform'd by ſeveral Ages, at length obtain'd the name of <hi>Maſoreticks.</hi> Laſtly, the Jewiſh Text may in many things be illuſtrated by the Samaritan. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. we read in the Hebrew, that God finiſh'd his work upon the <hi>Seventh Day,</hi> but in the other upon the <hi>Sixth Day;</hi> which ſeems to be the more proper Lection, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. This Sentence which is in the Samaritan, <hi>Let us go into the field,</hi> v. 8. ſeems to be wanting in the Hebrew; and many of the Jews mark this gap in the Margin of their Scriptures in theſe words, <hi>pauſa in medio verſus,</hi> a reſt in the middle of the Verſe. I know that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Hebraick Queſtions upon <hi>Geneſis</hi> has obſerv'd this <hi>Pericope</hi> for ſuperfluous, both in the Greek and Samaritan Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars; <hi>Superfluous,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is that in the Samaritan and our Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, Let us go into the field.</hi> But it appears that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in theſe Queſtions, where he profeſſes himſelf an Aſſertor of the Jewiſh Text, did not ſpeak ſo much his own, as the Opinion of the Jews, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. where we read that the ſojourning of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was 430 years, the Samaritan Exemplar comprehends, <hi>Their Fathers</hi> with the Children, or the ſojourning of the Patriarchs in the ſame <hi>Egypt.</hi> Which Lection agrees with the Truth, but is not Jewiſh. But it might have been, that they ſupply'd all theſe things in their Books, and that they might have been gloſſes for the Explanation of the Hebrew Text, which is frequently very obſcure.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, there are ſeveral things written with more freedom in the Samaritan Codex, which ſeem to have been added for Illuſtrations ſake out of other parts of the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch, by ſome of the Samaritan Doctors. Which Supplements, without doubt, argue the Copy to be vitious. In like manner the word <hi>Garizim, Deut.</hi> 17. which they have put in the place of <hi>Ebal,</hi> which was the Antient Reading, ſhews that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans were not over-religiouſly exact in their Copies; whence it is manifeſtly evinc'd, that neither the Samaritan, nor Jewiſh Exemplar, are free from all manner of Errour; ſo that they are to be lookt upon as Copies of one and the ſame Book, which may be uſeful to one another; yet ſo that the Jewiſh Copy, though it have its Imperfections, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before the Samaritan; not only becauſe all Religion and the Scripture deſcended from the Jews to the Chriſtians, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50875:52"/>becauſe the Exemplars ſeem to be leſs obnoxious to Errours. However, that ought to be no impediment, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For indeed the Reading of the Hebrew Text among the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans ſeems to be nothing near ſo ſtrict, in regard their Copies make no uſe of pointed Vowels, which confine the manner of Reading the Hebrew Context. And it is certain, that Points were a Modern Invention of the Jews; nor are they added to thoſe Volumes which are made uſe of in the publick Synagogues.

Moreover, <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ſeems to have condeſcended to this Opinion concerning the Diuturnity of the Hebrew Letters, not willingly, but by conſtraint, that he might refute <hi>Cappellus</hi>'s Book entitled <hi>Arcani punctationis Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati;</hi> and there he proves the Novelty of the Samaritan from the Antiquity of the Hebrew Characters. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> drew many into his Opinion.

But there is no reaſon for the Criticks to diſpute ſo fiercely about the firſt Hebrew Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50875:53"/>of this Letter <hi>Tau,</hi> one of which reſembles the form of a Croſs. <hi>Jerom Aleander</hi> likewiſe writing to <hi>Morinus</hi> concerning the Shekels of that Nation which he had ſeen in <hi>Rome,</hi> has theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon one piece of money; <hi>You ſhall ſee upon both ſides of the Coin the Letter</hi> Tau, <hi>in the form of a Croſs, which being former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written thus</hi> X, <hi>degenerated at length into this Form</hi> Ae.

And yet in our Age there is a certain Pariſian Divine, who has ventur'd to affirm, that the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law ſeem to be compos'd in a Language which was not then familiar with the People;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Mallet.</hi>
                        </note> and what is hardly to be credited, that moſt Learned Doctor has feigned a hundred monſtrous Stories of the Hebrew Language, of its Characters and Grammar, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt Author. But the Paraphraſes of the Sacred Text, which the Jews and Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans compil'd in their Mother Tongues, ſo ſoon as the Hebrew Language ceas'd to be familiar, plainly demonſtrate that the Scriptures were written in the Language of the Country. Whence aroſe that Verſion wrote in <hi>Syro-Chaldaick,</hi> not unele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant neither, which denotes its Antiquity. This is put forth in the Pariſian and Engliſh Verſions, and ſeems to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Samaritan Doctors, to be read in the Schools, and to the end that all the words of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law might be read, when the uſe of the Hebrew Language it ſelf was only among the Learned. The Samaritan Paraphraſe expreſſes almoſt <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi> the whole Hebrew Context; from which it ſwerves in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50875:54"/>but few things, moſt eſpecially in the names of Rivers, Cities and Countries, which he accommodates for the moſt part to the time preſent. Nor does he ſeem to be free from all prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiv'd Opinion, for which reaſon he tranſlates the word <hi>Elohim</hi> Angels. Thus where we read that man was tranſlated <hi>in the likeneſs of God,</hi> he renders it, <hi>in the likeneſs of Angels;</hi> and a little before, inſtead of theſe words, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods,</hi> as it is in the Hebrew, he renders the words, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Angels.</hi> Sometimes he confines the Hebrew words to his own ſenſe; as inſtead of thoſe words in the Latine Edition, <hi>The Spirit of God was carried upon the face of the Waters,</hi> he tranſlates it, <hi>Blew upon the Waters.</hi> But the Latine Interpreters of the Samaritan, ſeems not ſo accurate in all things, eſpecially in thoſe places where he differs from the Hebrew Samaritan, which in ſome places wants correction.</p>
                     <p>There was alſo a Greek Verſion of the Samaritan, for the uſe of the Samaritans, that us'd the Greek Language. Of which Verſion the Antient Fathers have ſo frequently made mention in their works,<note place="margin">In Exercitat. in Pent.

But in ſo ſaying, he is extreamly deceiv'd. <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> is alſo in an Errour, who denies that there ever was any Greek Verſion of the Pentateuch among the Samaritans; but that all thoſe Quotations by the Fathers of the Samaritan Codex, were taken out of <hi>Origens Hexapla,</hi> illuſtrated with Scholiaſts, where are various Lections of the Samaritan Exemplars. I do not deny but that <hi>Origen</hi> has cited many things by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Margin of his <hi>Hexapla.</hi> But the Fathers who make mention of the Samaritan Codex, cite the Tranſlation of the Pentateuch, which was read by the Samaritans, to whom the Greek Tongue was more familiar. And indeed there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that it could otherwiſe be; juſt as the Samaritan that ſpake Arabick, had a Verſion of the Pentateuch into Arabick. Yet <hi>Maſius</hi> ſuſpects there was no other Greek Verſion for the Greek <hi>Samaritans,</hi> than the Verſion of the LXX Interpreters. Tho it is much more likely that the Samaritans after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Helleniſt Jews, made a new Verſion for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that is to be us'd in Schools and private Houſes; the Hebrew Samaritan Context being always reſerv'd for the uſe of the Synagogue. To which we may add, that the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cited by the Fathers under the name of the Samaritan, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50875:54"/>in ſome things from the Tranſlation of the Seventy, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Chronicle of <hi>Euſebius. Maſius</hi> alſo teſtifies that <hi>Symmachus</hi> being an Ebionite, was for no other reaſon induc'd to make a new Tranſlation of the Sacred Text in the Greek, but out of meer hatred to the Samaritans, whoſe Opinions he had deſerted. This Greek Tranſlation agrees in ſome things with the former Samaritan Verſion, where it differs from the Hebrew Samaritan Text, as if the Greek had been taken from thence. But in regard they frequently differ among themſelves, there can be nothing certainly affirm'd in reference to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. All which is eaſily illuſtrated by Examples. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.23. where the Latine Interpreter rightly expreſſes the words, both of the Hebrew, as of the Hebrew Samaritan, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Darts,</hi> the Author of the Greek Verſion of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans tranſlates the ſame words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which agrees with the Samaritan and the Chaldee Paraphraſe. Soon after we read, <hi>v.</hi> 24. as well in the Jewiſh as Samaritan Hebrew Context, <hi>Beethan,</hi> which in the Latine Edition is rendred <hi>in Forti;</hi> in the Greek Verſion of the Septuagint, <hi>cum Fortitudine;</hi> but the Interpreters of both the Samaritan Verſions, have rendred the word <hi>in profunditate.</hi> Which Interpretation does not expreſs the Grammatical ſenſe, as they call it, yet it may ſo happen, that that ſenſe is commonly receiv'd by the Samaritans, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.19. We read in the Samaritan Verſion, and in both the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Texts, <hi>pro Deo,</hi> which the Greek Interpreter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans renders <hi>Timeo Deum,</hi> as if he had made uſe of a Copy quite different from all the Modern Exemplars; and yet R. <hi>Saadias Gaon</hi> has the ſame Interpretation in his Arabick Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, who nevertheleſs had no other Exemplars than what we uſe at this day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.22. Inſtead of the word <hi>Flies,</hi> which is read in the Latine Edition, in the Greek Samaritan Verſion the word <hi>Crow</hi> is made uſe of, the Interpreter miſtaking the word <hi>Oreb</hi> for <hi>Erob,</hi> which ſignifies a confus'd multitude of Flies or little Inſects. Which Errour may be imputed to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, by reaſon of the various manner of reading, becauſe of the want of Points in the Hebrew Samaritan Copy.</p>
                     <p>The Samaritans have alſo an Arabick Verſion of the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch, which was compil'd for the uſe of them that ſpake the Arabick as their Natural Language. For tho the Samaritans, like the Jews, read no other than the Hebrew Text of <hi>Moſes</hi>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:50875:55"/>Law, in their Synagogues, yet have they ſeveral Tranſlations for the ſeveral Provinces belonging to it. The famous <hi>Pereſcius</hi> had a third ſort from the Samaritans, but defective, wherein the Arabick Verſion was written in a Samaritan Character, of which there are ſome Copies however written in a Samaritan Character. <hi>Hottinger</hi> has inſerted the 4th chap. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> out of a certain fragment of that Arabick Tranſlation, both in Arabick and Latine, in the third Book of his <hi>Bibliotheca Orientalis.</hi> The moſt Learned <hi>Walton</hi> makes mention alſo of the ſame, which <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> communicated to him. The Samaritans have alſo other Arabick Books, written out however in a Samaritan Character. Thus J. <hi>Scaliger</hi> makes mention of a Samaritan Chronicle, the Epitome of which <hi>Hottinger</hi> has rendred into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine with this Title, <hi>An Epitome of the Chapters of the Book of</hi> Joſhua.

For they are the ſame with the Phariſees whoſe Traditions the Jews ſo greedily ſwallow'd, and ador'd, as if proceeding from the mouth of God. Therefore the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament came to the Chriſtians from the Phariſees, and not from the Sadduces.<note place="margin">Voſſius de Septuagint. Interpret. c. <hi>17.</hi>

                        </gap>, all that was written, rejecting only the Traditions of the Phariſees, which ſeem'd to them to be only the Figments of idle perſons. More notoriouſly do they miſtake, who believe the <hi>Carraeans</hi> to have followed the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in this particular. And which ſeems almoſt incredible, <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> otherwiſe a Learned Perſon, places the <hi>Carraeans</hi> among the <hi>Ebionites, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareans,</hi> and other Sects of the Jews, who retaining the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Moſaick Law, believ'd the Goſpel. Therefore it behoves us to relate in ſhort what the Sect of the <hi>Carraeans</hi> was, and what was their Opinion concerning the Sacred Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Karrai,</hi> from whence the <hi>Carraeans</hi> derive their name, ſignifies a man exercis'd in the Reading of Scripture. But that name, which was formerly reverenc'd, became to be hated, by reaſon of the Sect of the <hi>Carraeans,</hi> that firſt began to ſpread it ſelf toward the beginning of the 10th Century. They like the Rabbaniſts allow of twenty four Books of Scripture with the Tittl'd Vowels, and other Maſoretick Marks. In expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacred Scriptures they follow the Maſoretick Lection every where, eſteeming it no leſs than <hi>Aben Ezra, Kimchi,</hi> or any other of the Jewiſh Grammarians; and in imitation of them are great ſearchers after Grammatick Quirks. Therefore was <hi>Buxtorf</hi> horribly miſtaken where he writes, <hi>We have read of the</hi> Carraeans, <hi>who rejecting all the Traditions, only adhere to the Text, that they not only differ extreamly one with another,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>as to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Expoſition of things, but alſo in the Reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as refuſing points which they look upon as a piece of Oral Law,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50875:56"/>or Tradition. Buxtorf</hi> had had a quite contrary Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Carraeans,</hi> if he had lighted upon thoſe Books, which he ſeems not to have been furniſh'd withal. For they do not altogether reject the Talmud and Traditions of the Jews, but they preſume not to compare them with the Sacred Scriptures, as the Rabbaniſts. And therefore laying thoſe aſide, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after the manner of the Criticks, who are free from all prejudice, to draw forth that which ſeems to them to be the trueſt ſenſe of Scripture, by comparing one place with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking little notice of the Talmudick Expoſitions, which many times make large Excurſions far from the matter. And therefore if the Jewiſh Rabbaniſts ſpeak ill at any time of the <hi>Carraeans,</hi> as Corrupters of the <hi>Biblick</hi> Context, it proceeds out of meer Envy and Malice, not from heat of Diſpute. All which things may be more perſpicuouſly ſeen in the Books of the <hi>Carraeans</hi> themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aaron</hi> the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> of the Sect of the <hi>Carraeans,</hi> who wrote the Commentaries upon the Law, <hi>An.</hi> 1294. at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Book, deplores the lamentable ſtate of the Jews, and their being ſcattered into all parts of the World, aſſerting that Viſion and Prophecy was taken from them, and that they had almoſt forgotten the Hebrew Language. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Doctors appear'd among the Iſraelites, who ſearched out the Scripture, which contains the</hi> 24 <hi>Books in uſe among us.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Carraeans</hi> do not agree with the <hi>Samaritans</hi> upon this point, but with the Rabbaniſts allow the whole Scripture to be Canonical and Regular. And they alſo frequently call it a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, thereby to diſtinguiſh it from thoſe other Traditions, which the reſt of the Jews are not afraid to obtrude upon us. In the ſame place he rebukes the Cabbalick Doctors, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times propound for Scripture the Figments and Fables of their own Brains, and, to uſe his own expreſſions, <hi>depend upon the Cabbala, and tattle idle ſtories, and boaſt their Cabbala or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be above the Scripture.</hi> However, the <hi>Carraeans</hi> do not reject all manner of Tradition, but they ſeparate the ridiculous and uncertain from that which has ſome appearance of Truth; as the ſame <hi>Carraean</hi> openly teſtifies in theſe words; <hi>Nor let any one object to us, that we are Enemies to the Writing, Reaſon and Doctrine deliver'd to us by our Anceſtors. For this Tradition which we make uſe of was not loſt, and is comprehended in true
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50875:56"/>Scripture, not ſeated in variety; concerning which the Iſraelites in all things agree.</hi> This is that Tradition which caus'd them to approve by their Authority the Maſoretick Scripture receiv'd by all the reſt of the Jews, with the Points and Accents; which will be ſtill more apparent from the above quoted Commentary of the <hi>Carraean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a wonderful thing how ſtudious this <hi>Carraean</hi> was of Modern Lection and Grammar, when they appear uſeful to the Explication of Scripture. Sometimes he appeals to the moſt celebrated Maſters of the Jewiſh Rabbaniſts, to confirm his Opinion by their Teſtimonies; ſometimes he refutes them, eſpecially the Cabbaliſtick, and Allegorical Doctors. But much oftener he has recourſe to the Analogy of Grammar, than to the Teſtimonies of others. Thus at the beginning of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he has theſe words; Bereſchith <hi>is of the ſame form as</hi> Scherith, <hi>only that</hi> Aleph <hi>is not pronounc'd. Now it is known that the word</hi> Reſchith <hi>is a word that ſignifies time, and that it denotes the time that precedes, or that which is firſt of all;</hi> as <hi>Exod. c.</hi> 23. <hi>The firſt of the Fruits of thy Land;</hi> he adds in this place, that <hi>Reſchith</hi> is a name of time; then he reproves a certain Rabby by the name of R. <hi>Jeſua,</hi> who believes that the Angels were from the beginning; and <hi>oppoſes to him the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Miſnick Doctors, that the Angels were not created the firſt day;</hi> and makes it out from the words of Scripture, that there was nothing that day created; and that this was the common Opinion of the Interpreters.

                     <p>THE Hebrew Language remain'd ſo long entire and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to the Jews, while the Prophets abode in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who made their Sermons to the People in the Hebrew Tongue, which was then underſtood by all. But being carried Captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> they forgot their own Language, at leaſt all the vulgar people. Wherefore upon their return to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> they could not underſtand the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but with the aſſiſtance of the Rabbies, who interpreted the ſame in the Babyloniſh or Chaldee Idioms. To which purpoſe we read in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that <hi>Eſdras</hi> made him a Pulpit, whence he ſpake to the People; and, <hi>together with the Levites, read in the Law of God diſtinctly, and with a loud voice, to be underſtood:</hi> And after that, <hi>Then ſpake</hi> Nehemiah <hi>and</hi> Eſdras <hi>the Prieſt, and the Levites and Scribes interpreting to all the people,</hi> as it is moſt probable, in the Chaldee Language. Which Cuſtom is ſtill retain'd by the Jews in our Age diſpers'd over the face of the Earth. Thus the Spaniſh, German, Turkiſh, Graecian, Perſian, and other Jews, make uſe of Spaniſh, German, Turkiſh, Graecian, and Perſian Interpretations of the Text. And from the ſame Fountain I am apt to believe that all the Tranſlations and Paraphraſes of the Bible now found among the Jews deduc'd their Original. For it is not probable that it ſhould be the Original of that Tranſlation which goes under the name of the Seventy Interpreters. For the Jews of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who ſpake Greek, made for their own uſe a Greek Verſion, which afterwards fell into the hands of the Chriſtians. As for the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes, they were made at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and other places near adjoyning, whence they were tranſmitted into places farther remote. Thoſe Chaldee Paraphraſes are highly eſteem'd by the Jews even in theſe latter times, eſpecially thoſe which are attributed to <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi> But as to the Authority and Antiquity of thoſe Jews, the Learned are at variance among themſelves; and therefore becauſe no man has handled that point more accurately than <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite, a perſon long
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50875:58"/>vers'd in the Chaldee Tongue and Writers, it will not be amiſs to tranſlate ſo much of his words as ſhall be neceſſary for our purpoſe out of his Preface before his Chaldee Lexicon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When the Jews were carried away captive out of their own Land into</hi> Babylon, <hi>they forgot their own Language, as the Book of</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah <hi>teſtifies. So that all the knowledge of the Rabbies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons skilful in the Law, was chiefly publick in the Babyloniſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. In that the Babyloniſh Talmud was compos'd. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, during the time of the ſecond Temple their Language was for the moſt part Babyloniſh; which when</hi> Jonathan <hi>the Son of</hi> Uzziel <hi>became ſenſible of, he wrote a Chaldee Paraphraſe of the eight Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for the uſe of the People.</hi> Onkelos <hi>alſo wrote another of the Law. But the Hagiography was not tranſlated till long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Language of the</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>Talmud, as I ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards relate. In the mean time let us examine ſome things that concern the Paraphraſts themſelves. Firſt, why it is ſaid in</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara, <hi>that</hi> Jonathan <hi>was long before</hi> Onkelos. <hi>How</hi> Jonathan <hi>was one of the Diſciples of</hi> Hillel, <hi>who flouriſhed about a hundred years before the Deſtruction of the Temple; but that</hi> Onkelos <hi>was the Son of</hi> Titus <hi>who deſtroy'd the Temple. And if it were ſo, why</hi> Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <hi>firſt paraphras'd the Prophets, and did not begin with the Law. Our Anceſtors of bleſſed memory have reported indeed, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have explained the</hi> Hagiographers, <hi>but that a voice ſpake to him from Heaven, ſaying,</hi> Is it not enough that thou haſt laid open the Myſteries of the Prophets? Wouldſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to open the Myſteries of the Holy Ghoſt (that is, of the Books of the <hi>Hagiographers?</hi>) <hi>For that reaſon he did not para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon the</hi> Hagiography. <hi>But then another difficulty offers it ſelf, why he did not expound the Law? eſpecially ſeeing a Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtick Doctor Rabbi</hi> Menahem Rekanatenſis <hi>has wrote in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> Matzorang, <hi>that he alſo tranſlated the Law, where he has theſe words, And he ſent a live Bird.</hi> For theſe are his words. I found in the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziel,</hi> of happy memory, and <hi>he let go a live Bird;</hi> nor does he write other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in many other places. If this be true, it is a wonder how it ſhould be loſt in ſo ſhort a time, and not the leaſt remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Tranſlation be to be ſeen. We may alſo enquire why <hi>Onkelos</hi> did not tranſlate the Hagiographers, and why they continu'd unparaphas'd till the time of a certain Hieroſolymite, who explained them paraphraſtically. <hi>But who he was, or what his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50875:59"/>name was, or when he liv'd, is not certain. Thus the Hieroſolymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Interpreter who tranſlated the Law, is to us unknown, whether he be the ſame who interpreted the Hagiographers, or whether they were two Interpreters that liv'd at two ſeveral times. Some ſay that</hi> Aquila <hi>the Proſelite was the Author of both Paraphraſes; others there are affirm</hi> Joſeph <hi>the Blind to be the Author of both. And in truth I have found in</hi> Bereſchith Rabba <hi>taken out of the Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers and Prophets under</hi> Aquila's <hi>name, as that Verſe, Life and Death are in the power of the Tongue,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 12.</note> &amp;c. <hi>See in the Root</hi> Matztar. <hi>Alſo upon theſe words of</hi> Ezechiel; <hi>The Brides of their Adulteries.</hi> Aquila's Targum <hi>reads,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (<hi>that is,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the Antient Whore.</hi>) <hi>See the Root</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Thus</hi> Aquila <hi>alſo interprets ſome of the Garments of which</hi> Iſaiah <hi>makes mention. But there is no mention of Rabbi</hi> Joſeph<hi>'s Paraphraſe in</hi> Bereſchith Rabba, <hi>for he was not yet alive. But there is mention of it in</hi> Gemara <hi>upon certain Verſes of the Prophets and Hagiographers, which are not found in the Verſes of the Law. Know however, that the Language of</hi> Onkelos<hi>'s Paraphraſe differs in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Language of</hi> Jonathans. <hi>For both ſpeak the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Idiom, as do the Books of</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> Eſdras; <hi>yet their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is much more pure and elegant than that of the reſt of the</hi> Targums. <hi>As for the Hieroſolymitan</hi> Targum, <hi>it differs very much from the Babyloniſh, in regard it is compos'd of ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, the Greek, the Roman, and the Perſian. And becauſe ſo many Languages are found to be in it, this mixture ſeems to me to have begun from that time, when thoſe Empires had the Dominion over</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>Therefore is that Language call'd the</hi> Jeruſalem Targum; <hi>for that in that ſame mixture Rabbi</hi> Jonathan <hi>compos'd the</hi> Jeruſalem Targum <hi>about</hi> 300 <hi>years after the deſtruction of</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>At what time every body knows that</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was ſubject to thoſe Nations, as we find in the Book of</hi> Joſephus Goro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas. <hi>But at what time the</hi> Jeruſalem Targum <hi>was compos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law and the Hagiography, is unknown to us, whether before or after the Hieroſolymitan</hi> Targum <hi>was finiſhed; I aminduced to believe that the Hieroſolymitan</hi> Targum <hi>was never extant but only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Job, <hi>the</hi> Proverbs, <hi>and</hi> Pſalms, <hi>and not upon the five Volumes; for the ſtile is not the ſame, although in theſe there are many words ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Hieroſolymitan Author.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite, who at length confirms his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the difference of the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:50875:59"/>and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which he calls the Hieroſolymitan, from the <hi>Targum</hi> of the Five Volumes, by the example of the double <hi>Targum</hi> upon the Book of <hi>Eſther;</hi> of which the ſecond bears the name of the Hieroſolymitan. And that he again confirms by the Authority of <hi>Rabbi Solomon,</hi> and after a ſhort diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that the Author of the <hi>Targum</hi> of the Five Volumes is no more known than the Author of the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> For firſt, who <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> were, is utterly unknown, or in what Age they liv'd. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Antiquity alſo the Chriſtians much diſpute, while others led by the Teſtimonies of the Jews, believe their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes to have been made about the time that Chriſt liv'd upon Earth: Others think them later than <hi>Origen</hi> or St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> becauſe they neither make mention of them. Yet it might be that in thoſe very times they were known to the Babyloniſh Jews, where they ſeem to have had their Original; but not being yet reduc'd into one body, they were not made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly publick: And thus I have lighted upon ſome Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars of the Pentateuch, to which there was added to every word of the Hebrew Text an Expoſition in French; yet a French Paraphraſe upon the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was never yet cited by any of the Jews. And therefore it is very probable that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doctors of the Babylonian Schools expounded the Hebrew words in Chaldee for the benefit of the people, out of which in proceſs of time an entire Paraphraſe was compil'd. And to make me ſo believe the purity of the Chaldee Language wherein they are written induces me. Which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Paraphraſe only that goes under the name of <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelos</hi> upon the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and of that other upon all the former and latter Prophets, which are attributed to <hi>Jonathan:</hi> For that ſame <hi>Jonathan,</hi> or whoever elſe were the Author of the Paraphraſe upon the Prophets, did by no means compoſe that other, which is publiſh'd by certain Jews under <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s name; ſo different is the ſtile of both; which I wonder was not taken notice of by <hi>Huetius,</hi> and other Criticks, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found this ſame <hi>Pſeudo-Jonathan</hi> with the True and Antient <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> as if one and the ſame Author had paraphras'd upon the Pentateuch and the Prophets. But as for that ſtory of the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudick Doctors of the Voice that ſpoke from Heaven to deter <hi>Jonathan</hi> from explaining the Hagiographers, there is no wiſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50875:60"/>man but takes them for the dreams of the Jews. But firſt we are to take notice of what has been obſerv'd concerning the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Babyloniſh and Hieroſolymitan Dialects by the ſame <hi>Elias,</hi> who ſeems to ſet little or no value upon the reſt of the Paraphraſes which are extant upon the Hagiographers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were written by men of no name. To which we may add, that their Authors frequently ſwerve from the words of the Hebrew Text, foiſting in the room of thoſe Talmudick Fables and Stories of the ſame nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſtick much cloſer to the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet ſometimes they are not ſo very careful to expreſs it <hi>verbatim,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite teſtifies. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſts do not always obſerve the Rules of Grammar. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they render the Praeterperfect tence by the Future, and the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Praeterperfect tence, and ſometimes the Participle by the Praeterperfect tence and Future. Sometimes they interpret a Verſe as they judge moſt agreeable to the Targumick Language, not ſo much minding the Biblick Context.</hi> To this <hi>Elias</hi> adds the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <hi>Salomon Iſaac,</hi> whom we erroneouſly call <hi>Jarchi,</hi> who obſerves <hi>Onkelos</hi> not to be very curious of the Grammar of Scripture, but to have follow'd his ſenſe and judgment in many things; and ſometimes thoſe Paraphraſts have omitted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whole words, but whole ſentences. For indeed it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fate of all Paraphraſters, who tranſlate Books out of one Language into another, to follow the freeſt method of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. So that if there occur any difference from the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is preſently to be referr'd to its Cauſe and Original; and we are diligently to enquire, what might have been the Product of the various Readings of the Codex's, and what might be alter'd according to the Fancy of the Interpreter. However, this is chiefly to be taken notice of, that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Chaldee Paraphraſes was heretofore very confus'd and diſorder'd: For there was no Analogy of Orthography, the Letters <hi>Vau</hi> and <hi>Jod</hi> being without any diſtinction made uſe of, and inſerted into words without any ſignification. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Author of the Chaldee pointing obſerv'd no method in putting the Titles to the Chaldee Context, as <hi>Elias</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite plainly teſtifies, who was the firſt that poliſh'd the Chaldee Language. Now how difficult it was to frame a Chaldee Grammar, I rather chuſe to ſhew from the words of <hi>Elias</hi> himſelf, than my own.</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50875:60"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Many,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elias, ask'd me, whether a Grammar could be fram'd for theſe</hi> Targumims; I <hi>anſwer'd according to my own ſentiments, that I could not do it, in regard the Exemplars vary'd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well in words as in letters, and altogether in the points, which differ'd almoſt beyond all poſſibility of reconciliation. And that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from hence, becauſe the Paraphraſts wrote their Verſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out points, which were not yet invented, as I have truly demonſtrated in my Preface to</hi> Maſoreth Hammaſoreth. <hi>To this we may add, that the moſt Antient Exemplars are all without points, becauſe the Authors of the</hi> Maſora <hi>never pointed them as they pointed the reſt of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But a long time after they were pointed by one or more perſons, tho of no note, as they thought good. Therefore there is no Analogy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, neither can there be any method produc'd for the making of a Grammar. And indeed unleſs it were ſo, who could imagine that from the time that the</hi> Targums <hi>were compos'd, there ſhould be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among the Jews who had Erudition enough to frame a Grammar, as Rabbi</hi> Juda <hi>did, who was the</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">In this <hi>Elias</hi> is miſtaken, in affirming R. <hi>Juda</hi> to be the firſt Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an among the Jews, when there was before him Rabbi <hi>Saad as,</hi> whom he afterwards nominates.</note> 
                        <hi>firſt Grammarian of note; whereas before him there was no Hebrew Grammar. But becauſe he found the Sacred Books of Scripture noted with points and accents, as alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with a</hi> Maſora <hi>by the Maſorites, he began to aſſiſt the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and to enlighten the exil'd Jews with his Grammar. Him follow'd R.</hi> Jona; <hi>and after him came R.</hi> Saadas Gaon; <hi>and after them an innumerable company of Grammarians. But there was no perſon who animadverted upon the</hi> Targum, <hi>to correct what was amiſs; all ſlighted that buſineſs, ſo that it came forth perverted, which is only preſerv'd. Therefore I began to think of a way, whereby every one might be able to make a</hi> Targum <hi>Grammar in ſuch a manner, that he might take his foundation out of ſuch things as were wrote in the Books of</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> Eſther; <hi>and only upon that might build his ſuperſtructure, and deduce his Grammar Rules, if not altogether, yet in part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Soon after he adds theſe words in the ſame Preface; <hi>In times paſt before the Art of Printing was invented, there was not found above one</hi> Targum <hi>in the City, and one in the Country. Therefore there was no man who minded them. But there were many Exemplars of the</hi> Targum <hi>of</hi> Onkelos <hi>found, becauſe they were bound to read two Sections of Scripture, and one of the</hi> Targum <hi>every</hi> Sunday. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were ſome that made it their buſineſs to write ſomething up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but it came to little or nothing. There was alſo a</hi> Maſora <hi>made upon it, which I never could ſee; but there was no man who ſo much as open'd his mouth to explain the Prophets and Hagiographers. Neither was there any that requi'd it, but all cry'd, Let us let that work alone till</hi> Elias <hi>come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:50875:61"/>
                     <p>But when the Chaldee Grammar was once found out, which <hi>Elias</hi> had deem'd ſo hard to frame, preſently <hi>Munſter, Mercer,</hi> and other Learned men lent their helping hands to reform the Chaldee Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text: Above all the reſt <hi>John Buxtorf,</hi> who with a daring boldneſs caus'd to be publiſh'd a vaſt heap of Paraphraſes conformable to the method of the New Grammar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We have reduc'd,</hi> ſaith <hi>Buxtorf, the Chaldee Text, which is call'd the</hi> Targum,<note place="margin">In Praeſat. Bibl. Baſil.</note> 
                        <hi>and is a moſt noble Commentary upon the Hebrew Text in</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, to the Antient, True and Perpetual Analogy of the Old Chaldee Language, fairly ſhew'd us in the Books of</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> Eſther, <hi>refin'd from all the idle and deformed pointing, which is to be ſeen in the</hi> Venetian <hi>Editions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as it is excellently well obſerv'd by <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu,</hi> there are many things after all <hi>Buxtorfs</hi> Emendation, that require a better Reformation. In peruſing certain written Manuſcripts of the Sacred Text, I met with a Pentateuch written in large Letters in a large Parchment <hi>Folio,</hi> which contain'd the Paraphraſe of <hi>Onkelos</hi> in ſuch a manner, that a part of the Paraphraſe followed every Verſe of the Text. But in that Exemplar the Chaldee pointing wonderfully dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from all other that I could ever find as well among the publiſh'd as Manuſcript Copies. For it reſembled the pointing of the Books of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> far better than the <hi>Buxtorfian</hi> Edition. However, the firſt Edition of reforming the Chaldee pointing, is attributed to the <hi>Complutenſes,</hi> which being poliſh'd by <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards perfected in the <hi>Baſil</hi> Bibles. But it ſeems to be much more perfect in the Manuſcript which I have mention'd: Wherefore I am apt to believe, that before <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite liv'd, there were Jews that were both vers'd in the Chaldee Paraphraſes, and skill'd in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But ſuch Exemplars never fell into <hi>Elias</hi>'s hands; and I wonder the Jews, that over-look'd the Paraphraſe of <hi>Onkelos,</hi> made uſe of no better Copies. However, I would not adviſe any one to pin his Faith upon the Modern Pointing ſo much by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> reform'd, but where it ſeems to carry a more proper ſenſe. But rather to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Antient form of the Chaldee Context, which had no Points, as being lately invented by the Rabbies, and added without Art to the Paraphraſes. The Chaldee Pointing is not ſo Authentick as the Hebrew; for the latter had the Doctors of <hi>Tyberias</hi> for its Correctors, whoſe credit was no leſs than the repute of the School of <hi>Tyberias;</hi> the other known to few, and at this day unknown to moſt of the Jews.</p>

                     <p>I Doubt not but there are other Paraphraſes of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context, beſides the already mentioned, as yet not publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; for I find ſome, in reading the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> highly eſteemed by them not yet Printed. But theſe through the <hi>Jews</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> have been long ſince laid aſide. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tranſlation of the <hi>Bible</hi> into the Mother Tongues was abſolutely neceſſary, few of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Doctors excepted, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding even the <hi>Hebrew;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Arabic</hi> tranſlation of <hi>R. Saadias.</hi>

                        </note> yet I think it not amiſs to rank it among the Tranſlations uſed by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have long ſince received it from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to this our time is retained by moſt Churches. But the Diſputes about its Authority and Tranſlators, not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, may be a wonder; for there be ſome who deny its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, therefore others who highly maintain its Authority in all, eſteeming the Tranſlators as Prophets inſpired by the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Others again of a middle rank between theſe two extreams, do highly value this Antient and to be honoured Tranſlation of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> yet in ſome places they think it not Authentick. I willingly paſs by the Hiſtory of the Tranſlators as it is in <hi>Philo, Joſephus,</hi> and in ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, becauſe known to moſt. The Fathers borrowed the greateſt part of this Hiſtory from <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> in his Book,<note place="margin">The judgment of <hi>Ariſtaeus.</hi>
                        </note> of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Law, out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> into the <hi>Greek</hi> by the 70 <hi>Interpreters:</hi> and a part, ſince invented by the <hi>Jews,</hi> The learned <hi>Critics</hi> have thought <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi>'s Book in part ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitious, ſuppoſe the Book that goes under <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi>'s name were not ſuppoſitious, I ſhould think them no wiſer that quote him for the Truth of this Hiſtory, then he that thinks <hi>Xenophons Cyropaedia</hi> to be a true Hiſtory of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for as <hi>Tully</hi> upon the firſt ſight perceived that <hi>Xenophon</hi> did not act the Hiſtorian, but that in <hi>Cyrus</hi> he gave a Model or Pattern of a juſt Emperor, ſo it may eaſiy be ſeen in the Reading <hi>Ariſtaeus,</hi> that he is more Romantick than a true Hiſtorian. We may eaſily gueſs from the Context, that ſome <hi>Helleniſt Jew,</hi> writ this Book in favourof his Nation. The Writer of this Hiſtory, according to the Genius of his Nation, ſpeaks great things and Miracles: For he relates when King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> wondring that the Writers of other Countries,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50875:63"/>made no mention of that Excellent works, he bring in <hi>Demet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And he farther tells us, of one <hi>Theodectes</hi> a Tragical Poet, who when he had inſerted into his Play ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was ſtruck blind, till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon what he had done, and had intreated God by his Vows.</p>
                     <p>Theſe truly are more a <hi>Romance</hi> than a <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which always delighted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Miracles;</hi> there is ſuch another Story of a Voice from Heaven which did frighten the Writer of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe from the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the Holy Scriptures; moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Suppoſititious <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> ſeems to contradict here; for where he ſpeaks of <hi>Theopompus,</hi> he tells us, <hi>That the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>was before this tranſlated into the Greek Tongue;</hi> but if it were ſo why did they ſo earneſtly deſire another <hi>Tranſlation;</hi> wherefore <hi>Baronius</hi> and other learned Men with good reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>'s Authority chiefly induced by this reaſon ſay, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were not tranſlated before into <hi>Greek,</hi> and that there was no Tranſlation whatſoever before that of the <hi>Seventy Elders.</hi> Neither can you ſay,<note place="margin">Joſeph Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig ina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50875:64"/>
                        <hi>my Readers will ſuſpect my credit, but truly as it is not lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth, which hath been received; ſo it would be a Crime to be ſilent in this Affair, but as they have been acted, ſo I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated them, that I might avoid all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths, and for that reaſon I have endeavoured to receive the Truth from thoſe who were privy to the Kings Affairs.</hi> Truly he leaves nothing out that may corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate his Teſtimony which he feared would be ſuſpected by all.</p>
                     <p>But the Authority of the Fathers and other Writers of good Note and Credit, who have inſerted in their Works the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> as true, doth make for it; and it will be thought raſhneſs to defend the contrary, but we are not to conſider what the Fathers have ſaid, ſo much as the reaſons of their opinion; for in things purely critical Reaſons are of more moment than Authorities. It is evident the Fathers were moved by the bare Authority of <hi>Ariſtaus,</hi> or <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> who writ from him; but they had no reaſon to examin critieally the Hiſtory of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaeus</hi> whether true? Seing the <hi>Septuagint Tranſlation,</hi> which at that time the Church uſed againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had recourſe to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in their <hi>Diſputations</hi> with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> did greatly ſupport their Cauſe. The Fathers had been ill adviſed, if they had laid by that Tranſlation which the <hi>Jews</hi> could not totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. St. <hi>Jerom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jerom.</note> a man well verſed in all Learning, and had ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Criticiſm, for this reaſon contrary to the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Fathers</hi> did confute the <hi>Cels</hi> of the 70. <hi>Interpreters. I know not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who firſt invented the Story of the</hi> 70. <hi>Cells,</hi> and then laughs at <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who affirmed he ſaw them, and looks upon him as a ſimple Man eaſily induced to believe the <hi>Jews</hi> Stories. In like manner he differed in opinion from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for from the Authority of <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> himſelf and <hi>Joſephus</hi> he aſſerts the 70. <hi>Interpreters</hi> to have conferr'd and not to have propheſyed; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it is one thing to be a Prophet, another to be an Interpreter;</hi> the firſt foretels things to come, the other from his Knowledg afterwards and Eloquence Tranſlates. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he eſteem them more than <hi>Tully,</hi> who tranſlated with a Rhetorical, not a Prophetick Spirit <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s Oeconomy, <hi>Plato</hi>'s Protagoras and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>'s Oration for <hi>Cteſiphen,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ever of any other Opinion, although he may ſometimes ſay they were inſpired, and that the Learn'd Man did judge this to be taken in an Oeconomical Senſe, may appear by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50875:64"/>ſeveral Places. For the like reaſon although St. <hi>Jerom</hi> did ſeem to be of the ſame Opinion with <hi>Ariſtaeus, Joſephus</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time, that the 70. <hi>Interpreters</hi> did tranſlate Books of the Law only; yet in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon the other Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, he ſpeaks of them no otherwiſe than as the Tranſlators of theſe, and this becauſe he would not ſeem to differ from the common Opinion, although in his Judgment leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                     <p>But ſome one will ſay, if <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi>'s Hiſtory of the 70 ſhould be look'd upon as a Fable, what Foundation had it? For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the firſt Author could not invent it without ſome ground, when even the Fables of the Poets carry ſomething of Truth in them.<note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Ariſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Book. <hi>Heinſ.</hi> Ariſt. ſa.

                        <hi>Heinſius</hi> thinks this Story of the 70. to have its riſe from the xxiv. chap. of <hi>Exodus;</hi> where we find, that <hi>Moſes, Aaron</hi> and the 70. <hi>Elders</hi> went up unto the Lord, and from the words, which in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation are, <hi>nec ſuper eos qui procul receſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant de filiis Iſrael miſit manum ſuam,</hi> the Greek <hi>&amp; electorum Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el neque unus diſſenſit; Heinſius</hi> thinks that number of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators and their miraculous Agreement to have riſen hence, but whatever <hi>Heinſius</hi> thinks, I am of the Opinion that the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors</hi> were rather <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> than <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> for there are to this day ſome <hi>Egyptian</hi> Words as <hi>Abrec, Remphan</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and becauſe it was of ſo great a conſequence it is very likely it was approved of by the Sanhedrim, and there called the Septuagint Tranſlation from the 70 Elders, or Senators of the Great Council; for which reaſon the place of the Talmud otherwiſe very difficult, where the Greek Tranſlation is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed only to five, may eaſily be reconciled with the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of 72. by the ſame Authority it is made authentick to all the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Helleniſts</hi> as the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Church in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> have made their Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Authentick; for as the Ignorance of the Chriſtians in the Greek caus'd Tranſlations into the other Tongues; and theſe Tranſlations became Authentick to the Churches by their uſe, in like manner the <hi>Jews</hi> Ignorance of the Hebrew Tongue did move the Jews of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to tranſlate the Bible into Greek for their uſe, which Tranſlation was afterwards read in their Synagogues and Schools; and becauſe, as very probable it was approved of by the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> at Hieruſalem, upon whom at that time the whole Nation of the Jews had a dependance, it hath acquired the Name of the Septuagint.</p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:50875:65"/>
                     <p>Yet I think there is no neceſſity to have recourſe to the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the great Synagogue, that the number of the 72. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters (to whom that Tranſlation is commonly aſcribed) may be the better made out; but we are only to conſider the Form of Speech familiar to the Jews, by which they attribute every thing of moment to thoſe 70. Senators, that the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may acquire the greater Authority: For this reaſon they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the Vowel Points, Accents, and many other things of the like nature to the Sanhedrim, not ſo much from the reality of the thing, as from that Form of Speech; ſo that it is difficult to diſtinguiſh when they ſpeak plain and when allegorically: This way of ſpeaking hath led many men, and thoſe Learned, into various Errors, when in reading the Jews Books, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more what they write than the manner and cauſes of their ſo writing. We may bring for Example what occur in the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins about the <hi>Title</hi> of Holy Writ; the <hi>Keris</hi> and <hi>Cetibs,</hi> or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Readings entire, defective, redundant, and ſix hundred of the like nature. All theſe moſt of the Jews aſcribe either to <hi>Moſes</hi> in Mount Sinai, or to the Synagogue or Senate aſſembled under <hi>Eſdras;</hi> all which if not taken Allegorically after the manner of the <hi>Cabbala,</hi> as the Jews themſelves write, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe, for the ſame reaſon if we are not as attentive to the words, as to the manner of writing proper to the Jewiſh Nation, the Hiſtory of the 72. Interpreters not improbably will ſeem to ſpring from the ſame Fountain, whether it really was approved of by the immediate Authority of the Sanhedrim or whether through connivance publickly read in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues it at length by long uſe became Authentick, which truly ſeems more agreeable than what the falſe <hi>Ariſtaus</hi> ſays of the Approbation of the Greek Tranſlation in theſe words,<note place="margin">

                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:50875:67"/>as is aſſerted by ſome, that the <hi>Greek</hi> is to be preferred before the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> with ſome others of the ſame nature which come from thoſe who have more zeal then knowledge, if the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Maſius</hi> was now alive, he would wonder that any Proteſtant and <hi>Iſaac Voſius</hi> the firſt, ſhould have the ſame opinion of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, with thoſe divines he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends.</p>

                        <hi>Maſius</hi> had been wholy of our Opinion, if he had not given ſo much credit to the Story of <hi>Ariſtaeus,</hi> which he ſaw was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by a Cloud of Witneſſes, he ſhould rather have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Reaſon than plurality of Voices, neither truly will he judge otherwiſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation, who ſhall critically Examine it by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Originals. And this is the Opinion of all the Critic Expoſitors of the Scripture.

And thus we have already ſhewn how groſly <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> err'd in this particular, while he Tranſlated into his Treatiſe concerning the 70 Interpreters, the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and others of the Fathers, much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective withal then he need to have been both againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Manuſcripts.

                        <hi>Voſſius</hi> therefore affirms theſe 70 Interpreters to have been inſpir'd with the Holy Ghoſt, in which Opinion he has all the Fathers of the Primitive Times to back him except only St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> who varies from him in his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well concerning the Depravers of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, as touching the Inſpiration of the 70 Interpretors.

And now in our time <hi>Voſſius</hi> condemns his Verſion and calls it <hi>Rabbinical.</hi> But that moſt learned Father encountring thoſe Reprovers, that know how to find fault but could not mend, practiſed the Critical Art, and in his Writings ſufficiently ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd thoſe perſons that made ſuch a noiſe againſt him.

For Juſtice never defends manifeſt Errors. I know indeed that in matters of Faith the Conſent of the Doctors and Fathers of the Church carries ſomething of Authority: But he is neither generous nor religious who in matters that concern not Faith, is afraid to depart from the Opinion of the Fathers, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe other mens Writings then his own Eyes or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                     <p>Therefore have we no reaſon in this particular to agree with <hi>Voſſius,</hi> who contrary to the Opinion of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> would have the 70. Interpreters to be inſpir'd with the Holy Ghoſt, and free from all manner of Error. Nay as if he had been aſham'd to have given thoſe Interpreters the Names of Prophets, as if it were correcting himſelf, he affirms, the word <hi>Prophet</hi> among the Antient Writers to ſignifie no more than Interpreter, and thoſe to be Prophets according to the Teſtimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50875:72"/>who rightly interpret the Scriptures.

Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was made by the Jews of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Ptolemy Philodelphos,</hi> and copyed out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Manuſcript in <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Babylonic</hi> Characters; in regard the Jews made no uſe of any other Letters for tranſcribing the Scripture but only thoſe, after their Return out of Captivity: But as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Greek Verſion, which <hi>Voſſius</hi> believes to have been made by a Perſon learned neither in the Greek or Latin Tongue, badly and negligently copyed from the ſame Hebrew Exemplar in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> Letters, it is a meer Fiction taken out of the <hi>Pſeudo-Ariſtobulus;</hi> who nevertheleſs ſpeaks not one Tittle of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> wherein <hi>Voſſius</hi> maintains the ſame Copy to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; neither did any body beſides <hi>Voſſius</hi> ever dream of 'em; ſo far is it remote from all probability of Truth. They miſtake indeed, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> well obſerves, who believe that Verſion was deriv'd from any <hi>Chaldaic</hi> or <hi>Syriac</hi> Paraphraſe, there being no ſuch thing extant at that time, and it being as certain that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> takes the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Language promiſcuouſly for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50875:73"/>the ſame. However we may have ſome reaſon to conjecture, be had ſome regard to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Language, which was familiar to moſt of the Jews after their Return from Captivity. There was at that time neither <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Syriac</hi> Paraphraſe; yet long before that, the Rabbies, as well in their Synagogues as Schools, read the Scripture Text as often in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, whence it might come to paſs, that ſeveral words in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation were more adapted to the Idiom of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Syriac</hi> Tongue, then the propriety of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Speech.</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Voſſius</hi> invented another Fiction,<note place="margin">De Sybil orac.</note> aſſerting that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Time when <hi>Aquila</hi> flouriſhed, there was no other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture read in the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews,</hi> then the Verſion of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> in regard the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language was ſo forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the Rabbies themſelves did not underſtand it. But the 70 Interpreters, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> will have it,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s Errors</note> flouriſhed at what time the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language was familiarly ſpoken. But the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language was no more a Familiar Speech in the time of the 70 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, then it was when <hi>Aquila</hi> lived. For that it was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed after the <hi>Jews</hi> were carried Captive into <hi>Babilon;</hi> and after their return it ceaſed to be any longer the Language of the Country. How then could it be, that it ſhould only continue among the Rabbies, who taught it publickly in the Synagogues and Schools; or if it be true, that till the Time of <hi>Aquila,</hi> there was no other Scripture read in all the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the Greek Interpretation of the 70 Interpreters. How came it to paſs that <hi>Flavius Joſephus</hi> expounded the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> affirms, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that the ſame <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the moſt learned of all the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of his Age, ſet forth his Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, before he wrote it in <hi>Greek?</hi> Yet if we may believe <hi>Voſſius,</hi> the Hebrew Language was then wholly loſt: If it were ſo, why does he call it the <hi>Country</hi> Language of <hi>Joſephus?

In which ſence, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> relates, <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports of himſelf that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50875:74"/>he excell'd in the learning of his <hi>Country</hi> all the reſt of the <hi>Jews;</hi> but that he learnt the <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>Grammatical Inſtructions.</hi> Now he calls his <hi>Country Learning</hi> the knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew Language</hi> &amp; the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the <hi>Hyeroſolymitan Jews</hi> read in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language</hi> in their <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Nevertheleſs if we believe <hi>Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> who frequently contradicts himſelf, Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpake <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Judea.

By the Edict of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> they are permitted to read the Scripture not only in <hi>Greek,</hi> but in any other Language whatſoever; Therefore all the <hi>Helleniſt Jews</hi> in obedience to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> never read the Scriptures in their Synagogue in any other then in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, to which ſoon after their Domeſtic Native Language ſucceeded. Nor is this any way contradicted by the Teſtimonies of the Antient <hi>Jews</hi> and Fathers; from whom it is apparent that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and all thoſe other <hi>Jews</hi> to whom the <hi>Greek</hi> was familiar, read the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the 70. Interpreters in their Synagogues. In like manner it appears that there were certain Synagogues in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in which the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets were read in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. All theſe and many other Arguments that might be here collected together, ſerve only to prove, that the Reading of the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpretation was only added for expoſition's ſake to the reading of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. As now in our days, the <hi>Jews</hi> according to their ancient. Cuſtome every Sabbath day, read both in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee;</hi> becauſe that in the Ancient Synagogues, there were both Readers and Expounders; which Gift or Function of Interpreter or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was Tranſlated out of the Synagogue to the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, as appears by the Apoſtles words in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Chap. 4. Hence perhaps it came to paſs that the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpretation of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> in ſome places
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50875:75"/>leſs accurately expreſſes the words of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they who made it, ſupply'd the office of <hi>Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> rather then of Interpreters; eſpecially in thoſe places that were moſt obſcure.

                     <p>But much more worthy Obſervation are thoſe things which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> reports upon theſe words which he had Tranſlated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, <hi>Blind the heart of this People, and load the Ears of it,</hi> when the <hi>Greek</hi> interpretation ſeems much more kindly, wherein it was written, <hi>And the heart of this people became obdurate.</hi> But they who underſtand the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language know well, that this variance might proceed from the different pointing of the Vowels: and the 70 follow'd the pronunciation moſt uſual in their own time, which was different from what was practic'd when St. <hi>Jerom</hi> liv'd, and this is demonſtrable from the Maſcretic Exemplar. Both Readings are confirm'd by Tradition. But the <hi>Greek</hi> is here to be preferr'd before St. <hi>Jeroms,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50875:76"/>follow'd it in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles.

                        <hi>The ancient Doctors of the Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>report that St.</hi> Luke <hi>was a moſt skilful Phyſitian, and underſtood the</hi> Greek <hi>better then the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.

                     <p>Therefore St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems to be of that Judgment, that he beleiv'd, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> diſputing with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> did not ſpeak according to the <hi>Septuagint</hi> but according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text.

For ſometimes he accuſes the Interpreters, ſometimes the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers. In this Commentary alſo upon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Omiſſion of the <hi>Creek</hi> Copies he preſently adds; <hi>In divine Scripture it is better to take all in that is ſaid, though thou underſtandeſt not wherefore it is ſaid, than to take away what thou doſt not know.</hi> Nevertheleſs in the 5th Chapter of the ſame Prophet, he ſcarcely dares adventure to accuſe the Interpreters, where he ſays, <q>'tis much better to Tranſlate what is written, then to ſeek to defend a thing ill Tranſlated. Nor do we ſay this was done by thoſe to whom Antiquities has given Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but that after many Ages it was deprav'd through the negligence of the Readers and Writers, though both <hi>Ariſteas</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> and all the Schools of the <hi>Jews,</hi> aſſert no more than only the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to have been tranſlated by the 70 Interpreters.</q> Nor is it only in this place but in many other, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſeems to deny that any other part of Scripture was tranſlated by the 70, unleſs the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as upon the 5th Chap. of <hi>Micah,</hi> where he has theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. <hi>The Interpretation of the</hi> 70 (<hi>if were done by the</hi> 70, <hi>for</hi> Joſephus <hi>writes, and the</hi> Hebrews <hi>aſſert by Tradit on, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the five Books of the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>were Tranſlated by them, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But <hi>Voſſius</hi> is of a quite contrary Opinion, who not only ſeeks every where a Defence for a place ill tranſlated, to uſe the words of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> but openly teſtifies, that he makes no queſtion but that the Prophetical Books were alſo tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Seventy Interpreters, though formerly he made a doubt of it. And which ſeems to be above all belief, if we may credit <hi>Voſſius,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters ſhew themſelves
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50875:78"/>moſt accurate in the more obſcure Books of <hi>Job</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs.</hi> But I believe there is no perſon sikll'd in both Languages, who will agree with him in this particular, ſo trivial is the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation of thoſe Books in many places.<note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſometimes tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters without cauſe.</note> Yet am I not ſuch a one as to pin my ſleeve ſo paſſionately upon St. <hi>Jerome</hi> as every where to appove his Errors which are very many. Thus not to go farther, in the 27th Chapter of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon <hi>Ezekiel</hi> He taxes the Seventy Interpreters for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the <hi>Sons of the Rhodians</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Sons of Dedan,</hi> deceived perhaps by the likeneſs of the firſt Letter, whilſt they read <hi>Radan</hi> for <hi>Dadan.</hi> But that this miſtake is rather to be attributed to the Tranſcribers then the Interpreters thoſe Verſes which follow in the ſame Chapter plainly demoſtrate, where the Seventy write <hi>Dedan,</hi> as in St. <hi>Jeromes</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Again in the 33th Chapter of the ſame Prophet, where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of <hi>Gog,</hi> he obſerves, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters in the 24th of Numbers for <hi>Agag</hi> in the Hebrew have made uſe of the word <hi>Gog;</hi> But it is a manifeſt miſtake of the Tranſcriber. But to omit a thouſand thnigs of the ſame nature, the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> is much better in his 40th. Chapter of the ſame Commentaries, <hi>almoſt all the Hebrew words, and many in the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latine <hi>Tranſlation, were Corrupted by long Antiquity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd through the negligence of the Tranſcribers, and while they are Tranſcribed out of bad Copies into Copies more corrected, of</hi> Hebrew <hi>words they are made Sarmatic nay of no Nation at all, while they ceaſe to be</hi> Hebrew <hi>and become Forraigne.</hi> Therefore are thoſe things moſt carefully to be diſtinguiſhed, and according to the Rules of Criticiſm, which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> taxes as ill tranſlated by the 70. For as he has rightly diſplay'd the moſt of their Errors,<note place="margin">Praef. in l. <hi>7.</hi> Com. in <hi>Ezech.</hi>
                        </note> So he corrects many things, which deſerve not to be found fault with. Nor is it to be wondred at when St. <hi>Jerome</hi> himſelf teſtifies that he could hardly compleat his Emendations, in regard there was not an hour, ſcarcely a Moment, wherein he did not meet with whole troops of the Brethren, and for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then old beſides the difficulty of dictating, he was not able to look over the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Volums by reaſon of the ſmalneſs of the Print.

                        </note> that he could not rightly tranſlate ſomething, while he had not time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider for haſt of dictating. Therefore neither St. <hi>Jerome,</hi>

But when <hi>Origen</hi> inſerted them all in his <hi>Hexaples,</hi> together with the Verſion of the Seventy Elders, And that the ancient Fathers of the Church conſulted them in Expounding the Scriptures, and that nothing more frequently occurs then the names of thoſe Authors in the Writings of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> we thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to bring them in next after the Interpretation of the Seventy Elders.</p>

Now who will be ſo hardy as to affirm that he reformed every particular Error that was in thoſe Copies? Rather it might happen that under pretence of Correction, he might obtrude ſome Errors that were not there before upon the antient Exemplars, like that ſame Critic, who examined the Greek Edition, which is extant in the Bibles, Printed at <hi>Complutum,</hi> or <hi>Alcana de Henares</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> by the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies which were antient and of good repute, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo by the <hi>Hebrew Originals.</hi> Therefore as the Edition of <hi>Complutum</hi> is not therefore the more pure becauſe it comes nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Original; but for that very reaſon rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended and rejected as corrupt; ſo neither is that Edition of <hi>Origen,</hi> which St <hi>Jerom</hi> magnifies, becauſe it is more agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Truth than the <hi>Vulgar Greek</hi> Edition to be therefore thought the more pure and without Fault, becauſe it is more agreeable with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exemplars than the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> as being the foundation of all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I would fain know what elſe can be thence inferr'd but that <hi>Origen</hi> had a mind to diſtinguiſh by that name the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context from the Verſions that were made from it, as being the ground of all the Tranſlations. In which ſence St. <hi>Jerom</hi> calls the ſame Context the <hi>Hebrew Truth.</hi> Does it leſs from thence appear that the Context written in the <hi>Hexaples</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Characters took up two Columns, from which equally as from the Verſions, each of which was written in it's diſtinct Pages, the name of <hi>Hexaple</hi> was deriv'd? Moreover it is a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſame <hi>Voſſius,</hi> which he fains concerning the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Codex</hi> written in the Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> For that was unknown to the ancient Fathers of the Church <hi>Epiphanius, Jerom, Ruffinus,</hi> as alſo to <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Africanus</hi> whom he endeavours to draw to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither will ever <hi>Voſſius</hi> be able to demonſtrate by certain Reaſons what he ſo confidently aſſerts touching the <hi>Samaritan Codex</hi> which was in <hi>Origen</hi>'s hands, and vainly he produces for Witneſſes <hi>Euſebius, Africanus, Syncellus,</hi> nay even <hi>Origen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who never ſo much as dream't in their ſleep of this <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> Exemplar, written as he ſays in the Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> indeed had a <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> which was well known to the Fathers, and out of that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus, Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Syncellus</hi> took ſeveral Readings of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> Exemplar tranſlated from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> which they inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their Writings.

                        <hi>So great was the care and diligence which</hi> Origen <hi>us'd in his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Examination of the Sacred Writings, that he learnt the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Language, and bought up the Originals which were among the</hi> Jews, <hi>written in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Characters.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Reſp. ad Object.

For thus he reads the Sentence, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, whereas it is vulgarly read <gap reason="foreign">

And thus he renders it, <hi>That he learnt the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Language, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd to himſelf thoſe Scriptures which were written in the Original</hi> Hebrew <hi>Letters.</hi> Now ſaith <hi>Voſſius,</hi> in <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Sence, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Characters are no other then the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> had manifeſtly contradicted himſelf, if he had meant the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Letters of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he had wrote the contrary in his Chronicle. I cannot, but wonder at the Ingenuity of <hi>Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> to impoſe upon his Readers in a thing ſo plain and obvious to all that have but kiſs'd the threſhold of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. The Books of <hi>Euſebius</hi> are in every Bodies hands, whoſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the place already cited was no more then to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable pains and unwearied labour of <hi>Origen</hi> in peruſing the Books of Sacred Scripture and ſearching out their Sence; which that he might the more eaſily attain to, he learnt the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language from Jewiſh Maſters, read over their Books in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters, and compar'd them with the Verſions of the <hi>Seventy, Aquila, Symmachus,</hi> and others. Whether it be to be read <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> I will not at preſent diſpute, by reaſon that though <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s <hi>Lection,</hi> ſhould hold water, it is certain that by Prototype or Original Letters the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are only to be underſtood. That is to ſay, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context in <hi>Origen</hi>'s <hi>Hexaples</hi> is written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as has been already obſerv'd. Wherefore <hi>Euſebius</hi> then bearing in his mind the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exemplars, which were at that time read by thoſe who did not underſtand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50875:84"/>the Characters were <hi>Greek,</hi> aſſerts that <hi>Origen</hi> purchas'd an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Examplar written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters. For how could it otherwiſe be when the <hi>Jews</hi> were his Maſters and not the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans?</hi> I will acknowledg that the Examplars of the <hi>Samaritan Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch</hi> written in Characters different from the Jewiſh, were not unknown to <hi>Euſebius, Origen,</hi> and others of the Fathers; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of them did not underſtand the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, where they ſpeak of the <hi>Samaritan Codex,</hi> moſt aſſuredly they mean the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the <hi>Samaritan Pentateuch,</hi> which was then vulgarly expos'd. Nor do <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s words in his Chronicle favour <hi>Voſſius</hi> in the leaſt, where <hi>Euſebius</hi> makes mention of three Exemplars of Sacred Scripture from whence he drew his own: That is ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>from the</hi> 70 <hi>Interpreters,</hi>

                        <hi>from the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Exemplar of the</hi> Samaritans. For there, by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exemplar of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> of neceſſity the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of that Exemplar muſt be meant, no otherwiſe then as by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exemplar of the <hi>Jews,</hi> moſt of the Fathers who were ignorant of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language underſtood <hi>Aquila</hi>'s Verſion, which was Tranſlated <hi>Verbatim</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Therefore <hi>Euſebius</hi> knew that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> preſerv'd an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews;</hi> but becauſe he underſtood not the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, he conſulted the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion which was compill'd by the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> and which was at that time uſually read by them. As formerly <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> gives the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpretation of <hi>Aquila</hi> the Title of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; becauſe it was moſt in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time. But <hi>Voſſius</hi> never confider'd theſe things nor many others of the ſame Nature. Now then let us return to the buſineſs from whence we made this Digreſſion.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Hexaples</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> as may be ſeem by the Scheme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet down, the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew Letters</hi> obtains the firſt place, the ſecond the ſame Text in <hi>Greek</hi> Characters, in regard that from thence all the firſt Verſions of Scripture were derived. Then followed the Interpretation of <hi>Aquila,</hi> which followed the <hi>Hebrew Verbatim,</hi> and much cloſer than any of the reſt of the Tranſlators. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> was placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and not in the firſt place, as many thought, as the Teſt by which all the others were to be examined. This the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50875:84"/>of <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Theodotion</hi> accompany on each ſide, as not being much unlike it, and becauſe the ſame method of Tranſlating was obſerved in all the three.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe that vaſt Volume, containing ſo many Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as it were under one line, was of a great price, and to be purchaſed but by few, inſomuch that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> complained that the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Papers had emptied his purſe, <hi>Origen,</hi> of a moſt acute wit and unexhauſted knowledge, bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a way how he might bring all theſe Editions as it were into one. And becauſe at that time there was no other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture received in all the Churches, then the Tranſlation of the 70 Interpreters, he ſet forth that apart with certain Notes, by the advantage of which all the reſt were put to view; ſo that what ſeemed to be wanting in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context, he ſupplied out of <hi>Theodotion</hi>'s Verſion, with the addition of a mark which the <hi>Gramarians</hi> call an <hi>Aſterisk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Hexaple's epitomized.</note> as illuſtrating thoſe words of the Context, which were too much curtail'd, and as it were abbreviated. But if any thing ſeemed to abound and to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous in the Hebrew Context, in thoſe luxuriant places he added another Mark by the <hi>Critic</hi>'s called a <hi>Spit</hi> or <hi>Obelus,</hi> as of what was luxuriant in the <hi>Greek</hi> Edition of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> were to be cut and murdered as extravagant: And the chief Deſign of <hi>Origen,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teſtifies, in the Diſpoſition of that work was, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might the more eaſily be convinced by the Chriſtians in their Diſputes. Becauſe they frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that it was otherwiſe in the Hebrew Exemplar, than in the Greek Edition. The ſame is alſo teſtifyed by St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus;</hi> though St <hi>Jerom</hi> ſometimes gives a reaſon of thoſe Notes ſomewhat different. <hi>Origen</hi> had added alſo other marks to this Work in the faſhion of a ſmall <hi>Label,</hi> concerning the uſe of which the <hi>Criticks</hi> of our Age do not agree, and which has been hitherto revealed but by a few; we are to underſtand, that Greek Edition of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> with all thoſe illuſtrating and killing Notes in the <hi>Hexaples</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> was found toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Tranſlations of <hi>Aquila, Symmachus</hi> and the other Interpreters, as the words of <hi>Ruf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50875:85"/>Verſes, and in that which was another mans and not his own work, be affixed his own marks only that we might underſtand what was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſuperfluous not in reſpect of our ſelves, but of the Jews that diſputed againſt us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover the ſame <hi>Origen</hi> illuſtrated that vaſt work of his <hi>Hexaples</hi> with Scholiaſts of ſeveral ſorts, which he placed in the Margent of the Book, that he might give ſome Light to that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which appeared in the midſt between all the reſt. For firſt you might eaſily apprehend what was the diſtinction between the Antient or Vulgar Edition of the 70, and his own new Edition, by the benefit of this Mark <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which ſtands for 70 in Greek, that Mark <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> denoting the common Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Then in the ſame Scholiaſts, the Interpretations of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila, Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Theodoſion</hi> were every one demonſtrated by their proper Letter. A' denoted <hi>Aquila,</hi> Σ' <hi>Symmachus,</hi> and Θ <hi>Theodotion.</hi> The fifth Edition was marked with E', and the ſixth with <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, He alſo ſet Notes in the Margent of his Book for the <hi>verbatim</hi> expoſition of the words of ſacred Scripture, which are Printed in his works, under the Title of Scholiaſts. And more then this, if we will believe <hi>Voſſius,</hi> it is not improbable but that <hi>Origen</hi> marked in his <hi>Hexaples</hi> the various reading of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Codex. <hi>If any one will rather chooſe to believe that</hi> Origen <hi>did not inſert the</hi> Samaritan <hi>Exemplar into his</hi> Hexaples <hi>and</hi> Tetraples, <hi>but only marked the various Readings, I will not much diſpute the Buſineſs.</hi> Thus <hi>Voſſius</hi> fickle in his Judgment, ſometimes avers, ſometimes denies; and whereas before he had ſo confidently aſſerted that the Exemplar of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan Pentateuch</hi> was extant in the <hi>Hexaples</hi> written in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> Characters, now in a doubt he dares not be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in a thing wherein he has ſo little of certainty to make out. But as it is no way probable that the <hi>Samaritan Exemplar,</hi> which was the ſame with the <hi>Judaick</hi> was extant in the <hi>Hexaples,</hi> ſo it is very likely that <hi>Origen</hi> might transfer into his Scholiaſt the different reading of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> from the <hi>Judaic,</hi> which he did not take out of the <hi>Samaritan Exemplar,</hi> written in thoſe Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, but from the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the <hi>Samaritan Pentateuch</hi> corrected by the <hi>Samaritans</hi> themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Hexaples</hi> of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> which Perſons the moſt learned could not comprehend, while they do not mind that the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpretations of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,

                        </gap>; wherefore ſome are groſly miſtaken, who not underſtanding this diſpoſition of the <hi>Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> undertake to maintain that there is in them a double Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 70 Interpreters, as well the vulgar as that corrected and pure one, of which <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſo often make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, placed in two diſtinct Pages, and for that reaſon that the <hi>Hexaples</hi> did not derive their name from the diſtinct Columns, but the ſeveral Verſions, but theſe things are apparently untrue, and proceed only from the Ignorance of the order of the <hi>Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aples,</hi> to the Margent of which the ancient reading of the 70 was transferred, and thus both Editions of the Septuagint ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the <hi>Hexaples,</hi> now becauſe few could purchaſe thoſe vaſt volums that had emptied St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Pocket, moſt perſons tranſcribed that interlin'd Edition, mark'd by <hi>Origen</hi> with Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risks and Daggers and other notes of Diſtinction, from whence aroſe the greateſt confuſion in the World in the Greek Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars, and from that time the ancient Interpretation of the 70 was no longer read in the Churches, but the interlin'd one of <hi>Origen,</hi> which or another like to it, was afterwards tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Eaſtern Church by the Care of St. <hi>Jerome.</hi>

                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> he does not ſpare the very <hi>Eyebrows of the Biſhops,</hi> to uſe his own words, <hi>who endeavours to oppreſs whomſoever they ſee powerful in the Church and to Profeſs the word of God.</hi> But I ſpend time in vain; his Apologies againſt <hi>Ruffinus</hi> being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to be had. In which he ſtrenuouſly defends the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Verſion, and ſhews how much he profited in his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Scriptures under his Jewiſh Maſters, and how much by the ſame Inſtructors, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Euſebius</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others advantag'd themſelves; who while they diſpute about the Scripture, and endeavour to prove what they ſay, produce the <hi>Jews</hi> for Witneſſes and Patrons of their Opinions. And becauſe <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had objected to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that while he made his Tranſlation he was not inſpired with a Prophetic but a Judaic Spirit, He anſwers, <hi>Would it not ſeem tedious, or rather would it not ſavour too much of vain Glory, I could ſhew thee what an advantage it is to wear out the Threſholds of good Maſters, and to learn Art from Artificers.</hi> For St. <hi>Jerom</hi> wrote an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Pammachius,</hi> entitled, <hi>concerning the beſt manner of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating,</hi> wherein he refuſes the Calumnies of one <hi>Palladius,</hi> who at the Inſligation of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had beſpattered his Tranſlation. He there ſhews by many Examples, that it is not the duty of a good Tranſlator, to tranſlate his Authors <hi>verbatim,</hi> when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the 70 Interpreters nor the Evangeliſts follow'd that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Tranſlation. <hi>Aquila,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Proſel te and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Interpreter, who endeavoured to Tranſlate not only the words but the Etymologies of words is deſervedly rejected by us.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 70 Interpreters in the ſame Epiſtle he has this expreſſion. <hi>It is new too long to enumerate how much the</hi> 70 <hi>have added of their own, how much they have omitted, which in the Exemplars belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church, are diſtinguiſh'd by Lines and Aſterisks.</hi> Theſe and many other things of the ſame Nature he throws together into the ſame Epiſtle, to vindicate his own method or Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſomewhat more free and looſe then ſome of the reſt, from the Calumnies of his Adverſaries, and to the end his Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors might underſtand, <hi>That the ſence and not the words were to be conſidered in Scripture.

                     </p>
                     <p>Readily therefore St. <hi>Jerom</hi> acknowledges that in framing a new Tranſlation of the Sacred Text, he chiefly conſulted the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50875:88"/>Jews as his Leaders and Inſtructors; neither does he queſtion but that many things might ſlip him as a man; ſo far was he from the Opinion of thoſe, who aſſerted him in that underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be inſpir'd with the Holy Ghoſt, whom <hi>Mariana</hi> egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly refutes. <hi>What avails it,</hi> ſaith that learned Jeſuite, <hi>after ſo many Ages, to ſtrain for new Fictions to ſet up new Prophets?</hi> Shall we call him a Prophet, who in the framing his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion follows ſometimes the Greek Interpreters, ſometimes the Jews of his Age, upon whom he more frequently depends? Can he be ſaid to be a Prophet, who frequently but chiefly in his Commentaries upon the Prophets, doubts of the Genuine Signification of the Hebrew Words? 'Tis true I knew <hi>Pagninus</hi> and other Writers, eſpecially of the Proteſtant Belief, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that Verſion to be St. <hi>Jeroms,</hi> which for many Ages has been read in the Eaſtern Churches; but if you except ſome few Books of that tranſlation, which it is certain were not rendred by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> as they are extant in the Edition, no perſon tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly candid will deny but that this Interpretation which goes about under the Title of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> was really made by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> though there be ſomething in it of the ancient Latin Verſion, which before St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> time was only eſteemed in the Church. So that in ſome places, which however are very few, there does appear the reading of the Ancient Verſion, or elſe a mixture of both. And clear it is that that ſame Tranſlation was made by ſome native Latiniſt from the Hebrew Original. Now who in the whole Latin Church beſide St. <hi>Jerom</hi> at that time underſtood both Languages, that is, the Hebrew and the Latin? But they that deſire to know more of theſe things, let them conſult <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Eugubin,</hi> and <hi>John Mariana</hi> in their Writings upon this Subject.</p>
                     <p>Now that we may more perfectly underſtand the Nature of that Vulgar Edition, we muſt take notice that St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> tho he confeſſes himſelf not to have expreſſed the Words of his Text <hi>verbatim,</hi> and like a Grammarian, nevertheleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſticks more cloſe to his Words then the 70, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interpreters, ſo that he is not always like himſelf in his Tranſlation. Again we are to obſerve, that the modern Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Hebrew Text is not ſo often to be corrected from the Tranſlation of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> as it diſagrees from it; for tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he make profeſſion to have followed the Hebrew Truth, yet
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50875:89"/>ſometimes he forſakes it to follow the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think that the Hebrew Exemplar of his Maſters, which he frequently oppoſes againſt the 70 Interpreters is to be preferred in all things, ſeeing that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf had no O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Exemplar of the Hebrew Text, neither do I think we are to give Judgment upon the Verſion of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tranſlations which frequently vary from the other, but we muſt have recourſe of neceſſity to other Grammer Rules, then thoſe which have been ſet down by our late Inſtructors, as hath been at large demonſtrated, and which it is no difficult thing to confirm by many Examples. I ſhall therefore produce only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to puzzle the leſs skilful.</p>
                     <p>We find according to the vulgar Edition, in the oth of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> ver. 11. theſe words, <hi>Thou alſo in the Blood of thy Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haſt ſent forth thy Priſoners out of the Pit:</hi> but according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exemplars it ought to be rendred, <hi>I have ſent forth thy Priſoners,</hi> and the Pronouns <hi>Thou, thy, thine,</hi> are in the Feminine Gender, and ſo make the Sence far different from that of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> which agrees with that of the Seventy Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. Many to defend the vulgar Edition in this place, reject the J wiſh Exemplars, as corrupted by them on ſet purpoſe: But it is much more proper to ſay, that the ſame Pronoun in the Feminine Gender is taken ſometimes for the ſame in the Maſculine; which the <hi>Maſorites</hi> of <hi>Tyberias</hi> allow, who added the pointed Vowels to the modern Context. And thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the ſame thing to have happened in three places of Scripture, which they cite. Wherefore if the ſame occur in any other places which the <hi>Maſorites</hi> have omitted, the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Tranſlators are not therefore preſently to be accus'd, becauſe they do not agree with the later. In the ſame manner St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> may be vindicated for tranſlating the word, <hi>Thou haſt ſent,</hi> when according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> he ought to have tranſlated it, <hi>I have ſent.</hi> For this difference of Tranſlation aroſe from the Letter <hi>Jod,</hi> which is noted by the <hi>Mazorites</hi> to be often ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. The <hi>Mazorites</hi> themſelves reckon up 43 <hi>Places</hi> mark'd <hi>jather jod,</hi> that is, throw away <hi>Jod,</hi> as redundant. Thus <hi>Jer.</hi> 32 <hi>v.</hi> 33. where we read, <hi>Thou haſt taught,</hi> in the ſecond Perſon. The Hebrew word is written with Jod at the end, as if it ſhould have been rendred in the firſt Perſon. And indeed in the leſſer <hi>Mazorah</hi> it is marked to be read without a Jod, and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50875:89"/>Perſon, as <hi>Jerom</hi> renders it. But I paſs by theſe things, and many others, by which it might be made out, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Interpreter is often undeſervedly reprehended by thoſe that do not underſtand him, and meaſure all things by the Rules of their own Skill.</p>

In like manner the Greek and Latin Fathers in the primitive Times of the Church, embracing the Greek Verſion of the 70.

But the <hi>Syrian</hi> Tranſcribers, who being ignorant of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> could not conſult the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text from whence that was derived, committed many miſtakes, which nevertheleſs may be eaſily corrected without the help of <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi> However I do not believe the <hi>Syrian</hi> Tranſcribers to be as often under miſtakes as they diſagree from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Copy, ſeeing that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Exemplars vary themſelves. But
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50875:94"/>I ſpeak of thoſe Errors at preſent, which are without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie the meer failings of the <hi>Amanuenſis.</hi> I admire the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> in their Bibles took no notice of many which they let ſtand.</p>
                     <p>For to omit ſeveral others, who could have ſlipp'd this Error in the <hi>Syriac</hi> Verſion in the 14th Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> reads <hi>Gojim Nations,</hi> the <hi>Syriac Geloje,</hi> which the <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreters of the <hi>Syriac</hi> renders the People call'd <hi>Gelites.</hi> So in the 22 Chapter, where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Examplar has it <hi>Moria,</hi> the <hi>Syriac</hi> reads <hi>Omouroje,</hi> which the Interpreter renders the <hi>Amorrhaeans,</hi> as if there were any thing there mentioned of the <hi>Amorrhaeans.</hi> But theſe Errors I attribute partly to the <hi>Scribes,</hi> partly to thoſe who pointed the <hi>Syriac</hi> Verſion, in regard that points ſupply the place of Vowels, as well in the <hi>Syriac</hi> as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</hi> In like manner <hi>Gen. c.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 32. the <hi>Syerans</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Naſche</hi> or <hi>ſhrunk,</hi> have made of the Word <hi>Geneſio,</hi> which the Latin Interpreter tranſlates the <hi>female Sinew,</hi> and inſtead of the <hi>Sinew that ſhrunk,</hi> upon which the word <hi>Geneſio</hi> appears in <hi>Ferrarius</hi>'s <hi>Syriac</hi> Lexicon, which nevertheleſs ſeems to be ſome corrupted <hi>Hebrew</hi> word and not to be numbered among the <hi>Syriac.</hi> But I ſay no more of theſe nor of ſix hundred more. This is only worthy of obſervation, that the <hi>Syrian</hi> Scribes have erred in Writing out the <hi>Syrian</hi> Exemplars far more frequently, then the <hi>Jews</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſ.</hi> 19. in inſtead of King <hi>Baſan,</hi> the <hi>Syriac</hi> reads King <hi>Mathnin.</hi> Which diverſity proceeds from this, that the <hi>Syrian</hi> Scribe did not diſtinguiſh between <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> In like manner for <hi>Kiriath Jearim,</hi> the <hi>Syriac</hi> reads <hi>Kiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath Naarin,</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> renders it the City of <hi>Naarin.</hi> So in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Judges</hi> the <hi>Syriac</hi> reads <hi>Nedubaal</hi> for <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baal,</hi> and Chapter 9. <hi>Neptha,</hi> for <hi>Jeptha:</hi> all which might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been mended, with many more of the ſame nature. Wherefore as to the <hi>Syrian</hi> Exemplars that have been ſet forth in Print, we may truly affirm, what St. <hi>Jerom</hi> aſſerted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies: <hi>That ſome of the words are not only not</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>but Barbarous and Sarmatic.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could alſo enumerate thoſe places where the <hi>Syriac</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, forſaking the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> follows the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the 70 Elders. Which variety nevertheleſs of Interpretation is rather to be laid upon the Scribes who ſtrove to make the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation conformable to thoſe other Exemplars either <hi>Syriac</hi> or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50875:95"/>
                        <hi>Arakick</hi> which were Tranſlated from the <hi>Greek</hi> Edition. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. both in the <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> we find it, <hi>upon the ſixth day;</hi> whereas in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <hi>the ſeventh day,</hi> and the Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Jerom</hi> upon this place prove this Lection of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text to be the moſt Ancient. In like manner, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. This Clauſe, <hi>let us go into the field,</hi> was Tranſlated out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion into the <hi>Syriac,</hi> while St. <hi>Jerom</hi> teſtifies that in his time the ſame was not to be ſound in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exemplars. Laſtly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. Where mention is made of the <hi>Crow</hi> which <hi>Noah</hi> ſent out of the <hi>Ark,</hi> both in the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> we do not find that ever the <hi>Crow</hi> return'd; but the negative particle is not to be found in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context, nor was it there in St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> time, as may be eaſily prov'd from his Writings. From whence we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the Verſion which the <hi>Syrians</hi> call <hi>Pure;</hi> from it's anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perfection, is much degenerated, and now to be call'd rather mix'd then Pure. Thoſe variations which ariſe from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent marking of the Numbers I paſs by; as for example, <hi>Judges</hi> 16. Where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the Vulgar read 1100. the <hi>Syriac</hi> Verſion numbers 1300. 1 <hi>Sam. c.</hi> 6. for 50070. in the <hi>Hebrew Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> the <hi>Syriac</hi> reckons 5070. But no man can be ignorant that there are frequent variations of numbers in all Books of the ſame nature. There are other Examples of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Readings of more moment in the <hi>Syriac</hi> Tranſlation, which altogether alter the Sence, ſuch are, ſome in the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> eſpecially in the diviſion of their Allotments to the ſeveral Tribes. Another Alteration there is in the <hi>Syriac</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar where all the Inſcriptions of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are left out, on purpoſe to put others in their places. The reaſon of which ſeems to be, for that anciently the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or Argument of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> was prefix'd at the beginning of every <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Whence it came to paſs that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Inſcriptions of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> which did not explain the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to the liking of the <hi>Syrians</hi> were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and others added by the <hi>Syriac</hi> Rabbies.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Syriac</hi> Language and it's various Dialects, I ſhall ſay nothing at preſent, in regard that many have already learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handl'd that Subject. We are only to diſcourſe of thoſe things which concern the <hi>Syriac</hi> Verſion. Therefore what before we have obſerv'd touching the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Exemplars, to which the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies of <hi>Tiberias</hi> added the Points that ſupply the place of Vowels, that is now to be noted as to the <hi>Syriac</hi> Exemplars, to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50875:95"/>which the <hi>Syrian</hi> Doctors have added the Pointed Vowels which now appear in their Coppies. Therefore <hi>Walton</hi> is in an Error, who believes that <hi>Gabriel Sionita,</hi> the <hi>Maronite</hi> of Mount <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> was the firſt that inſerted pointed Vowels into the <hi>Syriac</hi> Exemplar: <hi>He was the firſt,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaking of this <hi>Gabriel, who pointed it, and added the</hi> Latin <hi>Interpretation of the ſame. For before, all the Manuſcripts were either deſtitute of points, or if any word or vowel happen'd to be pointed, in another it was omitted, one Syllable pointed and another naked, as we ſee at this day in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript Copies.</hi> That this is partly true I will not deny, for that the <hi>Syriac</hi> written Copies ſome have more, ſome have leſs points at the pleaſure of the Tranſcribers, who nevertheleſs ſeldom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Principal. Yet I have met with Manuſcripts that have been exactly pointed. <hi>Abraham Ech<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But whether there were any Verſion of the Scriptures before that time I ſhall not now enquire, it being certain that moſt of thoſe Verſions now us'd by the people that inhabit the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Regions are not now the ſame which in former times were made uſe of in the ſame Country.

In the Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> we find the names of <hi>Greece, Turkie, Choraſan, Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia, France, Cyprus</hi> and the like. Yet all the Errors of that Verſion are not to be imputed to the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the moſt without doubt being committed by the Scribes. Thus <hi>Joſ.</hi> 11.

                        <hi>Moreover whereſoever the</hi> Latin <hi>Tranſlators differ, or a reading is ſuſpected to be corrupt, we muſt have recourſe to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in which the Scriptures were writ, as St.</hi> Jerom, <hi>and</hi> Auſtin, <hi>and other Eccleſiaſtical Writers direct, ſo that the ſincerity of the Verſions of the Old</hi> Teſtament <hi>muſt be examin'd by the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>and the New by the</hi> Greek <hi>Copies.</hi> But who would believe that this Cardinal who ſpeaks ſo great things of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſhould, by and by, in another Epiſtle to his Readers, ſo baſely detract from it? ſo that we have reaſon to ſuſpect theſe paſſages were foiſted in by others. <hi>We have plac'd,</hi> ſays the Cardinal,<note place="margin">The ſame Cardinal in his Prologue to the Reader.</note>

                     <p>But it's evident that <hi>Pagnine</hi> err'd in many particulars. For firſt, he declar'd that he would keep cloſe to the <hi>Latin</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, except in ſuch places where 'twas abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to do otherwiſe: Notwithſtanding which he often deſerted it without any colour or ſhadow of reaſon, only that he might follow <hi>Kimchi</hi> and other latter <hi>Ribbins</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For how came it about, that for theſe words in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which in the Vulgar Tranſlation are, <hi>Spiritus Dei ferebatur ſuper aquas, the Spirit of God mov'd upon the Waters,</hi> he ſhould render, <hi>Spiritus Dei ſuperflabat in ſuperficie aquarum, the Spirit of God breath'd upon the Face of the Waters,</hi> unleſs becauſe the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, and ſome Doctors of the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſo explain'd it. Again who could brook the Verſion of the ſame <hi>Pagnine</hi> in the ſixth <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> who for theſe words, which in the <hi>Latin</hi> Edition, are <hi>nòn permanebit ſpiritus meus,; my Spirit ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abide,</hi> he put <hi>nòn erit ut in vaginâ ſperitus meus, my Spirit ſhall not be as if 'twere in a Scabbard.</hi> He was not content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Senſe of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word only, but likewiſe the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of it juſt as <hi>Kimchi</hi> had done it: Wherefore he ſhew'd himſelf a fooliſh and quarrelſome Interpreter. (As <hi>Aquila</hi> of old had done) in ſpeaking ſo barbarouſly.

Neither does he always follow the Senſe of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; thus in the 8 <hi>Chap,</hi> of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter excellently well renders theſe words from the <hi>Hebrew, legerunt in libro in lege Dei diſtinctè; they read in the Book in the Law of God diſtinctly;</hi> But <hi>Pagnine</hi> contrary to all Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Tranſlates it ſo, <hi>legerunt in libro in lege Dei expoſiti: They read in the Book of the Law of God Expounded</hi> in which place he contradicts himſelf, for in his Dictionary thoſe very words are otherwiſe explain'd.

                        <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> was not the Author of the new Verſion of the <hi>Bible,</hi> he was content to correct <hi>Pagnines</hi> Tranſlation in ſome places.

                        <hi>Hebrew</hi> exactly without any reſpect to the Senſe; thus in the 9 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where <hi>Pagnine</hi> has pretty well render'd <hi>novi quià nondùm timeatis, I know becauſe ye will not yet fear,</hi> the Corrector <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> turn'd, <hi>novi quià antequàm timeatis.

An infinite number almoſt of ſuch abſurdities may be found in this Tranſlation, which I adviſedly forbear to mention. Who, for Gods ſake, can underſtand <hi>Arias</hi>'s Interpretation of that <hi>Verſe</hi> of the 110 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where for theſe words, which we read in the Vulgar Edition, <hi>tu es Sacerdos in aeternum ſecundùm ordinem Melchiſedec, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> In <hi>Pagnines</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>ſecundùm morem Melchiſedec; thou art a Prieſt after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Melchiſedec.

But notwithſtanding all this <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous among all Learned men, for that vaſt and truly Royal Work of the <hi>Polyglot</hi> Printed at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which Verſion by the command of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, was had in eſteem beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and was likewiſe approv'd of by an unanimous conſent of many <hi>Pariſian</hi> Divines, in the praiſe of which they ſpake as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>we ſaw the holy</hi> Bible <hi>of</hi> Philip <hi>the Second ſet forth in</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Syriac, Greek, <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>after the manner of the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plutenſian <hi>Bibles formerly Printed in</hi> Spain. <hi>We approv'd of the ſame, and in a word, thought it fit to be read by all Catholicks in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all falſe and heretical Tranſlations, with which men endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to impoſe upon thoſe that have not arriv'd to the knowledg of the Tongues.</hi> This Work was likewiſe approv'd of by two Popes, as <hi>Franciſcus Luca, Burgenſis</hi> relates, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. in his Epiſtle to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain</hi> calls it, <hi>opus verè aureum, a work truly great.</hi> This is farther corroberated by the Authority of 42 Spaniſh Divines notwithſtanding all which, <hi>Arias Montanus</hi>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:50875:99"/>has but an ill repute among many of the Clergy in <hi>Spain,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for that he ſet forth a <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, not only on the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> as Cardinal <hi>Ximenius</hi> had done, but on all the reſt of the <hi>Bible</hi> except ſome few Books. Of this <hi>Andrews de Leon Zamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſis,</hi> a Minor of the Regular Clerks, complains in an Epiſtle which he wrote to thoſe that Printed a new <hi>Polyglot</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where concerning the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe publiſh'd in the Royal Bibles, he ſpeaks thus: <hi>What ſhall I ſay of the</hi> Chaldee <hi>Paraphraſe which the</hi> Rabbins <hi>call the</hi> Targum? <hi>Tis vitiated and extreamly corrupted, 'tis degenerated from it's ancient purity and candour, full of Talmudical Fables, and Sacrilegious Impoſtures.

                     <p>THere are yet greater differences betwixt the Proteſtants in their Tranſlations of the Bible, than the Catholicks. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Munſter,</hi> who turned the Old Teſtament out of Hebrew into Latin, ſhews the reaſons and method of his Tranſlation, at the very beginning of it; where he plainly tells us, how that he followed the Rabbins therein and not the old Interpreters. So that if there happened to be any faults in it, they were to be imputed to the Jewiſh Doctors, who were the firſt Authors of them. <hi>Sextus Senenſis</hi> gives us his opinion of this Tranſlation in theſe words. <hi>Munſterus ubique horridus, ſenticoſus &amp; aſper uſque adeo Hebraici ſermonis horrorem ſequutus eſt, ut cum multa Latinis auribus molliter accommodare potuiſſet, omnes tamen Hebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci ſermonis proprietates &amp; phraſes adeo ſervare ſtuduit, ut nec ipſos Hebraicorum nominum ſtridores pretermittere voluerit, ingerens La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinis auribus ubique pro</hi> Ozia Uzzijah, <hi>pro</hi> Ezechiele Jechezohel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I wonder that <hi>Sixtus</hi> ſhould be ſo nice and critical, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſo highly commends <hi>Cajetan, Pagnin, Oleaſter</hi> and ſome others, who affected a far more barbarous and unpolite Style.

                     <p>Likewiſe <hi>Leo Juda, a Zuinglian,</hi> Tranſlated the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at leaſt the greateſt part of it, out of the Original Hebrew into Latin, and becauſe he died before 'twas quite fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, <hi>Bibliander</hi> and <hi>P.

This Tranſlation was firſt publiſhed at <hi>Zurich</hi> in the Year 1543. and afterward in the Year 1545, there came forth a ſecond Edition of it by <hi>R.

But the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Divines rail'd and inveigh'd bitterly both againſt the Edition and the Publiſher of it; ſo that after many hot and wrangling diſputes about ſeveral things belonging to the Bible, <hi>Stephanus</hi> was at lenght forc'd by the prevailing party, to leave his Country, and to fly to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> for Sanctuary; there he writ his Apology againſt the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Divines, and publiſhed it both in Latin and French, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he made grievous complaints of them; but in moſt things he ſhowed himſelf to be an Innovator and a rigid follower of <hi>Calvin:</hi> Yet he was defended in ſome things even againſt the <hi>Pariſian Divines</hi> by <hi>P.

Neither did this Tranſlation of <hi>Leo Juda</hi> eſcape the Cenſures of <hi>Genebrard;</hi> who thereby got the Favour and Patronage of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, he himſelf being one of the ſame faculty.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50875:101"/>Spaniſh Divines; who without any ſcrupulous enquiry after the Authors name; or without any regard to the cenſures of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> reprinted this Edition at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> with ſome ſmall variation of the notes; and moreover judged it worthy to be read of all thoſe who were inquiſitive after the true meaning of the Scripture. 'Tis true that <hi>Leo Judae</hi> render'd ſome Hebrew words leſs properly than <hi>Munſter,</hi> but be took more care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them to the Latin Phraſe: So that he cannot juſtly be accuſed for any thing, but his tranſlating by way of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, purpoſely to avoid obſcurity.</p>

                     <p>AFter the riſe of new Hereticks in the Weſtern Church, who caſting aſide Traditions, would acknowledge no other rule and ſtandard of Religion beſides the Scriptures; there were ſeveral warm diſputes betwixt Divines of all perſwaſions about this very thing. The more prudent and moderate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, did not abſolutely condemn the Tranſlations of the Scriptures into the mother Tongue of every Nation, becauſe it was allowed of by the Fathers: But they judged it requiſite to ſtop the increaſe and progreſs of Hereſie, which ſprung from ſome miſinterpreted and perverted Texts of Scripture, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the promiſcuous reading of them in the vulgar languages, by reaſon of ſeveral inconveniences which attend it, without a due regard to the Perſons, Times, and ſome other circumſtances. Faith according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> comes by hearing, and 'tis certain, far more have been converted to Chriſtianity by hearing of the Goſpel than by reading it. At the firſt promulgation of the Chriſtian Religion, there were no Books of the Goſpel, from which Men might have learned the Principles of their Religion, &amp; 'tis very probable, that if the Apoſtles had never write any thing about the Chriſtian Faith, yet our Religion by the help of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, had been tranſmitted unto us entire and perfect. This is the general opinion of the Catholick Doctors, who do not poſitively forbid theſe Tranſlations, if ſo be all perſons in all times and places be not promiſcuouſly permitted to read them, for 'tis their Maxim.</p>

                     <p>Now 'tis eaſily prov'd, that almoſt all Chriſtians before the riſe of the Proteſtant Innovators, had the liberty to peruſe the Scriptures in their native Tongues. For what other reaſon
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50875:104"/>ſhould the Grecians prefer the Septuagint to the Original He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, but that the Greek was their Mother Tongue. Likewiſe the People of <hi>Italy</hi> had the Bible Tranſlated into Latin, becauſe they naturally ſpoke it, and for the ſame reaſon the Eaſtern Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had their <hi>Syriack, Coptick, Arabick</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which for brevity I ſhall omit. 'Tis true that ſome Tranſlations are now read among theſe People, which they do not underſtand, as the Latin is at this day among the <hi>Italians;</hi> but this is no convincing argument, that theſe Tranſlations were never in the Languages familiarly known and underſtood by the common People. Now I paſs to the Tranſlations of the Bible into the modern Tongues. <hi>Jacobus de Varagine</hi> is highly eſteemed among the <hi>Italians</hi> for his Tranſlation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into their Tongue: But now there are ſome other <hi>Italian</hi> Tranſlations much in vogue, which carry the names of <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Malermius</hi> Abbot of the Monaſtry of St. <hi>Michael de Lern</hi> and <hi>Anton. Bucciolus;</hi> and in ſome Editions there is a Preface, in which the Author diſcourſes at large of the Tranſlations of the Scriptures into the vulgar Languages, but there is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt <hi>Brucciolius</hi> and ſome other Interpreters: He turn'd the Bible immediately out of the Original, whereas they only tranſlated it from the Latin Interpretation, which was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally read in the Weſtern Churches. There are ſeveral Editions of this immediate Tranſlation from the Hebrew, the firſt of which the Author dedicates to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1530. afterwards there came forth three other Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Years 1539, 40 and 41, but the Edition in the Year 1540 is accounted the beſt, becauſe there are ſeveral very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Marginal Notes in it, together with an Epiſtle of <hi>Antonius Brucciolius</hi> to <hi>Renata</hi> the Wife of <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> in the defence and commendation of the Tranſlations of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the Vulgar Tongues, yet this Italian Interpreter ſeems to be too weak for the management of ſo noble and weighty a deſign; ſeeing he ſticks not cloſely enough to the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> but follows other Tranſlations, eſpecially that of <hi>Pagnin,</hi> whoſe very errors he has copied out, adding ſome more of his own in ſome places, which he did not underſtand. For in the 8 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> where <hi>Pagnin</hi> perverts the Original by rending it; <hi>In lege Dei expoſiti,</hi> he tranſlates it, <hi>Nulla lege d'Iddio dichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arata,</hi> differing as much from <hi>Pagnin,</hi> as the Hebrew Text:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50875:104"/>For becauſe he ſearched not into the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, he did not take notice that the word which fignifies <hi>Lex</hi> is of the Feminine Gender, and that the Participle paſſive, which he render'd by <hi>Dichiarata</hi> was of the Maſculine Gender; and ſo while he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, without conſulting the words of the Context, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Pagnin,</hi> whom he did not well underſtand, he falls into a downright error. I ſhall forbear to ſay any thing of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of <hi>Jacobus de Voraign;</hi> becauſe I never ſaw it. <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> who had a Copy of it, gives no very great Character of it; but others highly commend it. But, I think I may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm, that very few of thoſe Tranſlations, which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Latin</hi> Editions, can be accurate and correct; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it happens very often, that the <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreter cannot be underſtood without ſome knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue: hence it is that <hi>Jacobus de Voraigne, Mattermus,</hi> and others, who turn the holy Scriptures out of <hi>Latin</hi> into another Tongue, are often guilty of groſs miſtakes.</p>
                     <p>There were ſeveral Tranſlations of the <hi>Bible</hi> into <hi>French</hi> long before <hi>Calvin</hi> was heard of:<note place="margin">Gall. Verſ.</note> For before the Catholick Religion was reform'd, or rather deform'd by him, a <hi>French</hi> Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scriptures was read in <hi>Geneva</hi> and the neighbouring Mountains, which was compos'd in the year MCCXCIV by one <hi>Guiars des Moulins,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Aria</hi> in <hi>Artois,</hi> formerly under the juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Terovenne,</hi> a Copy of that Tranſlation is ſtill kept in the publick Library at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and another at <hi>Paris</hi> in the ſtudy of the Famous <hi>Henry Juſtelle,</hi> and I am of opinion that this is the Tranſlation which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Robert Olivetanus,</hi>

Moreover, 'tis evident that the Divines of <hi>Lovaine</hi> were not the firſt, as is commonly believ'd, who Printed the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation of the holy Scriptures. We have a Tranſlation publiſh'd at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the year 1530, by <hi>Martin L' Empereur,</hi> with the Priviledge of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, but we can have no certainty of that Edition; becauſe the year of the Impreſſion diſagrees with ſomethings contain'd in the Priviledg, <hi>viz.</hi> that the year 1530, was the firſt year of the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:50875:105"/>the Fifth, who was made Emperour in the year 1529. Beſides, in the ſame Priviledge, the Inquiſitors and ſome other Divines are mention'd; who had the inſpexion of that work; but at that time and in theſe places there was no Inquiſition. To theſe things may be added another obſervation drawn from the third <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where we find theſe words, <hi>Ipſa conteret caput tuum,</hi> which occur in the <hi>Latin</hi> Edition, to be render'd the ſame way in this Tranſlation, as the Proteſtants render them, <hi>viz. cette ſemence briſera ta teſte.</hi> Moreover in the Preface to this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, we have the ſame diviſion of the Scriptures, which we find in the Proteſtant Bibles: for there theſe Books are only rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd to be Canonical, which were writ in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, and receiv'd into the Jewiſh Canon. But we may give a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anſwer to all theſe Objections. Firſt, ſome error may be couch'd in the Priviledge, as we may gather from ſome other Editions of this Tranſlation. Secondly, 'tis very probable that the true Inquiſitors are not mention'd in the Priviledge. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis no wonder that he find <hi>cette ſemence,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation, becauſe the Tranſlation tells us, that he follow'd the old Interpretation. Laſtly, the Author of this Tranſlation, who alſo Tranſlated the Edition of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Title Page, might have imitated St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in the diviſion of the Scriptures, at that time there being no Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> againſt it: Neither did Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who writ a long time after, give any other diviſion of them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not ſay any thing at preſent of the Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> whoſe Tranſlation is generally read among the Catholicks, and which hath been ſeveral hundred times Printed and Re-printed, and alſo accurately corrected: Which work they did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, upon any other account, but that they might draw the Common-people, and the unlearned from the reading of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles, which were then had in great eſteem. Likewiſe thoſe Divines who Tranſlated the <hi>Bible</hi> into the <hi>Engliſh, German, Poliſh, Hungarian,</hi> and ſome other vulgar Languages, profeſs they did it on purpoſe to divert the Catholicks from reading Proteſtant Tranſlations.

                     <p>IN the days of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third a <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation of the <hi>Bible,</hi> done by ſome Heterodox Divines was publiſh'd at <hi>Metenſium,</hi> whereof that great Prelate did not a little complain being informed by the Biſhop of the above-named place that no ſmall number of the Laity, Men, and Women made it their buſineſs to read a certain <hi>French</hi> tranſlation of the <hi>Bible,</hi> that they frequented ſecret Conventicles, ſlighted the public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and defying the Catholic Clergy to the face began to floot at their ſimplicity. Which aforeſaid tranſlation might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be borrowed of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> people of that time. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>Wickleviſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> want their Vulgar tranſlation, whereof, I hear, that ſomething is as yet remaining. Now we may obſerve that theſe, and ſuch like tranſlations were done only out of the <hi>Latin;</hi> by reaſon their Authors were unskill'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongues. <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> a man of a bold, and refractory Spirit, was the firſt, who took upon him to do an old Copy out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and a new one out of the <hi>Greek</hi> into the Mother tongue; who was a ſmatterer only in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> when this his impoliſh'd, and erroneous tranſlation (a tranſlation afterward rejected by men after his own heart) came to cope with the Vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> which for many years before, and that in the judgment of all Divines was generally received, and approved both in Churches and Schools. And yet the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſticks not to be his own Trumpeter, and applauding himſelf for a Linguiſt, boldly aſſerts, that as for <hi>all the ſtratagems of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, all the tophitical Tyranny of the School-men; yea, and the whole Kingdom of Antichrist, he had invaded, ſubdued, and totally overthrown them.</hi> Nay if we may believe him, he telleth us, that he and his Languages were a terrour even to <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelf. <hi>The Devil,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not ſo much afraid of my Faith, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Hence it was that the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Proteſtants, mighty Adorers of this <hi>High-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Tranſlation, together with thoſe of <hi>Suecia, Finland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Ireland,</hi> and the reſt of the Northern People, who had formerly ſtuck cloſe to <hi>Luthers</hi> Errors, openly declare their readinſs for a new Tranſlation of the Bible; being that, That of <hi>Luthers was done all in a hurry;</hi> and that, as <hi>John Leuſden Hebrew</hi> Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>

And yet, as Mr. <hi>Lueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> tells us the <hi>Anabaptiſis</hi> ſtood up Tooth and Nail for this <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Tranſlation, reſenting it very highly that <hi>Johannis <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novis</hi> ſhould take upon him to Correct <hi>Martin Luther</hi> upon the New Teſtament.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now 'tis our Province to enquire what order and method, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> obſerv'd in his farewel Tranſlation of the Scriptures.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50875:107"/>Since he publickly aſſerts, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is void and ineffectual, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are not men to be believed; and that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Tranſlating the Scriptures was not inſpired with Chriſtian wiſdom; jumping into <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his opinion, who gave out that the above named Holy Father was a <hi>Jew</hi> in heart. For he wonders that any Chriſtian will concern himſelf with the ridiculous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of the <hi>Jews; The Jewiſh</hi> trifles (ſaith the ſame <hi>Luther</hi>) <hi>argue their Authors to know little or nothing of Holy-Writ; and yet forſooth theſe are the Idols of our Modern and Famous Divines; Divines moſt dexterous in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Tongue, and yet the moſt apt to hunt after ſuch like whimſies.</hi> He hath likewiſe a touch upon thoſe Rabbys, whoſe Talent is moſt commonly employed, and laid out in Grammatical affaires, decrying them thus, <hi>That they may know perhaps the Nominal and bare ſignification, but as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and intrinſic that they are ignorant of it; and that therefore nothing of ſoundneſs and ſolidity may be expected from them.</hi> Hence it is that he rejects the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tranſlators, and their adherents, as a pack of Fools &amp; Ideots, who would pretend to ſhelter the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, within the roof of the Scriptures. And he thought it much better that the more obſcure places of Scripture ſhould be expounded by the Analogy, or Rule of Chriſtian Faith, than by any Rabinical Books, by reaſon the once loſt <hi>Hebrew</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be retrieved, and that the true ſignification of a great many words in that Language is yet unknown, even by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, as well as by the Chriſtians: <hi>The uſe and knowledge of the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Tongue</hi> (ſaith <hi>Martin Luther</hi>) <hi>is ſo much loſt and eſtranged, that it can never be recovered; neither do the words only (but alſo the very Phraſes and Conſtruction) lye under a moſt doubtful, and various obſcurity: Hence it comes to paſs that we know not the force, Figures and Emphaſis of a great many words and ſentences; which if any Chriſtian may ever ſift out, ſo as to know their meaning, he muſt neceſſarily be one of thoſe men, who with the help of the New Teſtament hath acquired to himſelf the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That ſeveral particulars in this Method of <hi>Luthers</hi> may be hooted at, is paſt diſpute, more eſpecially thoſe objections which he offer'd againſt the Tranſlators of his Time, in that they depended too much upon Rabbinical Books. And yet the true reaſon why he pretended to calumniate theſe men was, becauſe they had ſpoke againſt the impropriety of his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50875:107"/>Tranſlation. <hi>Luther,</hi> I ſurmize, was in the fault when he ſtood diſſatisfied not only with the Books of the modern <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo with St <hi>Jerom,</hi> and the ancient Interpreters, whom when he had ſtrangely diſreſpected, he betook himſelf (as though all the world were Fools but his worſhip), to a certain imaginary rule of Faith, upon the faith of his own Brain. Moreover being no great Critic in Grammer he was found guilty, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of ſeveral miſinterpretations; ſo that truckling under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and Opinion; he giveth us for theſe words (in the 4th Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi>) <hi>Poſſedi hominem per dominum, I have gotten a man from the Lord. Poſſedi hominem Dominum, I have gotten the man Lord.</hi> Certainly <hi>Luther</hi> was no ſtranger to the Cabaliſtical Doctor's Opinion, who out of this place would gladly raiſe up a <hi>Meſſia.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Luther</hi> in the firſt Edition of his Tranſlation had rendred theſe very ſame words thus; <hi>acquiſivi hominem Domini; I have got the man of the Lord;</hi> which Interpretation was much more diſconſonant to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text than the other. For truly it was not poſſible that ſuch a Novice in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſhould not ſometimes lye under moſt palpable miſtakes. Wherefore his own Diſciples were not affraid to reviſe, and correct their Maſters Tranſlation, a Tranſlation (I confeſs) which they allowed ſome elbow room within the Bible, and deſcended ſo far as to write their own corrections in a different Character, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon them within two ſtroaks, which you may ſee in the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narienſian</hi> Bible, where <hi>Luther</hi>'s Tranſlation, and the aboveſaid Animadverſions are expoſed to the view of the World, yet how much men of his own principles eſteemed it, we may eaſily conjecture, ſince the Corrections added to it procured it the general applauſe of the <hi>Lutherians,</hi> as the moſt accurate Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Paulus Eberus</hi> who calleth himſelf Paſtor of the Church at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> uſed the Proteſtants in the ſame manner, as <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Clarius</hi> did the Catholicks. This man corrected the vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi> and added thereunto <hi>Luthers German</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, declaring that in as much as was poſſible for him, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlator, whom notwithſtanding you may afterwards find very much aſhamed of his Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, having ſo low thoughts of his endeavours, that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Bible might not be republiſhed, becauſe that, being diſtracted by other buſineſs, when he compos'd it, he had run into ſome miſtakes.</p>

                     <p>Now there is extant a <hi>German</hi> Tranſlation done by the Doctors of <hi>Tigurino</hi> and chiefly of <hi>Leo Judas,</hi> who was moſt particularly concerned therein, which Tranſlation openly oppoſes that of <hi>Luther.</hi> And yet the ſame Doctors of <hi>Tigurino</hi> forged a new one as though the former Verſion had not been found and good. The Authors of this late Tranſlation are (are as I hear) <hi>Hottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Heideker Mulerus</hi> and others who have tranſlated the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> words almoſt <hi>verbatim. Piſcator</hi> a man of great account among the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> is reported to have done a Bible into the <hi>German</hi> tongue, who though he relyed upon <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> their <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion, yet he did not hang back, but kept a full pace with the above named Tranſlators. The low <hi>German</hi> Tranſlation, which was taken into conſultation at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> in the year of our Redemption 1618, came forth in the year 1637; and by orders of the higher Powers was done into <hi>Low-Dutch</hi> immediately out of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and not from <hi>Martin Luthers High Dutch</hi> Tranſlation, was found errouneous. Neither doth the <hi>Low-Dutch</hi> Tranſlation want its faults, ariſing from a more than ordinary dependance upon the Expoſitions of the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> who were raſhly ſuppoſed by them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Hebrew</hi> better then all the World beſide. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this Tranſlation met with brisk oppoſition from ſome of the the Proteſtant Faction; and <hi>Low-Germany,</hi> the Country wherein it was hatcht, was quickly markt out with the brand of novelty and affectation. Mr. <hi>Leuſden</hi> Hebrew Profeſſour in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> a man before commended, taking upon him to argue for the <hi>Low-Dutch</hi> Tranſlation among the reſt of his proofs, produces as arguments the Corrections of the vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Clement Octavus,</hi> Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the true reaſon why theſe two Prelates ſhould Correct the vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi> was far different from that of the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Proteſtants. The former Animadverſions, without vain affectation, deſired only to make the vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> anſwerable to its ancient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies: whilſt the latter ſort of men, magnifying the <hi>Hebrew</hi> varities, which they pretend always to ſtand by, ſet out every day, and jump't up new Tranſlations of the Bible; which as ſoon as they come a little in vogue, the Authors of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perkt up, ſhow their faces, and ridicule the Old Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour, making it their end, and aim to build up their Yeſterday Opinions, upon theſe new and unheard of Tranſlations: being
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50875:108"/>the ſole way they make uſe of to thruſt their monſtrous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines into the Church, and which they do openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſaying, <hi>That the Sun of the</hi> Eaſtern <hi>Languages ariſing, they betook themſelves to the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Fountains, the better to find out, and confute the errours of Popery, the better to eſtabliſh their Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants was cloy'd and overcharged with the numerous Tranſlations of the Bible, the bare words of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> in his conference at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court may be of ſufficient evidence. <hi>If each man</hi> (begins the Biſhop) <hi>had his peculiar fancy we could never expect an end of Tranſlation; wherefore the good will and pleaſure of his moſt Excellent Majeſty 'tis, that ſome uniform Verſion be thought upon; adding moreover, that then he had never met with an Engliſh Bible well Tranſlated, and was very well ſatisfied, that among the bad ones, that of</hi> Geneva <hi>was the worſt: where he then thought expedient that the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in both the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities ſhould confer notes together and make up a Tranſlation, which being firſt reviſed, by the moſt Learned Biſhops, and Privy Council, ſhould at laſt be eſtabliſhed by the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The which being done, the Church of</hi> England <hi>will be confin'd to one Tranſlation and no more.</hi> We may eaſily from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with what noyſe, buſtle, and diſpenſion the diverſities of Bibles came accompanied into <hi>England,</hi> under the different Names of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Theſe, and a great many more particulars of the like Nature were order'd by the Kings Royal Authority; and accordingly effected; ſo that to this intent there is no Tranſlation made uſe of in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one only ſet forth by his Majeſties eſpecial command. To which Tranſlation truly their Book of Common Prayer may bear ſome reſemblance, which Book except the Verſion of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> hath been ſo far from the leaſt alteration, that it hath been uſed in their Publick Worſhip ever ſince their Reformation, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of the Tranſlations of the <hi>Bible,</hi> which were writ in the vulgar Tongue, and their Riſe from the <hi>Geneva</hi> Schools.</head>
                     <p>WE find not any <hi>French</hi> Tranſlations of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and done out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which went not to School at <hi>Geneva,</hi> neither do I omit that Tranſlation which may ſeem to be compoſed by <hi>Renatus Benedictus,</hi> one of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Divines; ſince the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation, and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named piece are moſt nearly related, as I ſhall hereafter make evident. <hi>Robertus Olivetanus,</hi> born in <hi>Picardie,</hi> and a nigh kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Jo. Calvins,</hi> was the firſt that attempted that great work, and at laſt finiſhed it in the year of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1535, which was the firſt year of the Reign of that monſtruous Religion, ſet up at <hi>Geneva,</hi> by <hi>Jo Calvin,</hi> ſince that before that time (as the above named teſtifies) ſome old Copies only of an old <hi>French</hi> Manuſcript were read in theſe and ſuch like places, and thoſe without an Author. Now what method <hi>Olivetanus</hi> followed in his Tranſlation, we may know by his Preface, which method truly was not ridiculous had he been fit for the undertaking ſuch a task. Though in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim ſeveral circumſtances ſufficiently demonſtrate unto us the Tranſlator's ignorance in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues. As for the <hi>French</hi> I dare not ſay he underſtood it, being that <hi>Jo. Calvin,</hi> who looked over this Tranſlation, leaves this for an Animadverſion, That the Author writ falſe <hi>French.</hi> Neither truly in his famous Preface doth he ſhew any competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he had in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> when he tells us a Tale of a Tub, and ſtories only fit for three-days-ſtanding-<hi>Hebrecians;</hi> where he learnedly obſerves <hi>R. Aben Ezra</hi> himſelf. This <hi>Olivetanus</hi> therefore did not take the trouble upon him to do the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy into <hi>French,</hi> but with much more eaſe followed ſome forerunning Interpreters. Since he telleth us of two <hi>Italian</hi> and three <hi>German</hi> Tranſlations of the Bible, at that time extant. And yet in the very beginning of his work, he proteſts that he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50875:110"/>ſcorned the equipage of a Learned mans Footman, that he was free from prejudice, and leaving other Tranſlations, betook himſelf to the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> That he had marked the more obſcure places of Scripture with an <hi>Aſterisk,</hi> and put down other mens Comments in the Margent.</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Olivetanus</hi> ſets a great value upon the different Readings of the Bible, more eſpecially upon thoſe, which he had obſerved out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpeters and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> through the great light which they give to the Scriptures. Wherefore he openly declares that he values not the help of the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> or the aſſiſtance of their Books; neither is he affraid to maintain that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Vowels were firſt foiſted in upon the Bible by the Doctors of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and therefore for his part prized the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> much above the common <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible. Neither in writing <hi>Hebrew</hi> will he imitate the Modern <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors; but prefers himſelf before them, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the new Jewiſh Pronunciations as Monſtrous, though in the laſt place he acknowledgeth that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> knew the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue better than himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The gifts of <hi>Heterodox</hi> Men muſt certainly ſhine forth in a miraculous manner, before they win the applauſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, though <hi>Robertus Oliveranus,</hi> I am fully perſwaded, <hi>knew, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Gentleman, I muſt needs confeſs, very ſeldom takes any notice of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent readings, and ſcarce at all looks back upon the Ancient Tranſlatours: Sometimes truly he ſticks to a leſs obvious ſenſe, as in 1 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> where for theſe words which are in the vulgar, and in a manner all Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And to the end he would not be called in queſtion concerning any affected novelty, he produces in open Court as Witneſſes of his true Tranſlation, certain of the Greek Fathers, who were of the ſame opinion, though at the end of his Book he inſerts a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fferent Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus <hi>Olivetanus</hi> ſlid into a great many groſs miſtakes, not only through his Ignorance in the Hebrew and Greek, but likewiſe in the Latin. Hence it is that having a greater reſpect for the Latin Tranſlator, then the Hebrew Copy, an Ocean of Errors overwhelm him; an Example whereof we have in the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50875:110"/>1 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> where for <hi>cete grandia</hi> in the Latin Tranſlation, he gives us in the French <hi>Grandes Baleines.</hi> But how he can make <hi>cote</hi> agree to <hi>Balana;</hi> I ſee no reaſon; being the word general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken denotes Creatures of an oblong, vaſt and prodigious Bulk. And which is much more unſufferable <hi>Olivetanus</hi> in the 25 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> where the Latin Tranſlator readeth <hi>Lampas,</hi> he commits a grand miſtake, by adhering too much to a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and ſetteth down <hi>Lampe.</hi>

                        <hi>Jo. Calvin,</hi> though he was no greater Critick in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> than <hi>Robertus Olivetanus,</hi> yet he openly declares the Tranſlation not only to be Mungril <hi>French,</hi> but that it ſtood Guilty of a whole Catalogue of Errours. And yet he had applauded this very ſame Tranſlation before, and foſtered it under his Authority, wiſhing that all learned Men would make it their buſineſs to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that immenſe and laborious work; and then to publiſh a Tranſlation of their own, which he would have preſented to the more wiſe, knowing and ſober Divines. <hi>Hen Stephens</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed theſe Animadverſions of <hi>Jo. Calvin,</hi> in the year of our Redemption 1535, who being an Acute, Ingenious and very Judicious Man, and no Novice in the Holy Scriptures, dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly corrects a great many things in <hi>Olivetanus</hi> his Edition, and through his great ability in the French tongue, clear'd it from all the obſolete words. And yet he minded the matter more than the words, and for perſpicuities ſake write a Paraphraſe in Place of a Tranſlation. Now and then no great occaſion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him away, he recedes from <hi>Olivetanus</hi> his Tranſlation, tho he keeps to the Gentlemans method, and puts down ſeveral Notes and Expoſitions in the Margent, tho not ſo often as <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetanus</hi> himſelf. He is much out in preſenting us with a ſenſe leſs proper in the Context, and a more plauſible one at the end of the Book, which miſtake aroſe from his ſmall acquaintance with the Hebrew Propriety. <hi>Olivetanus</hi> had wiſely inſerted in his Copies ſome Marginal Notes borrowed from the Ancient Tranſlatours, which <hi>Jo Calvin</hi> impudently takes away, as in the 6th. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> where you may read both in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and the Vulgar Latin, <hi>non permanebit ſpiritus meus,</hi> he following <hi>Olivetanus</hi> tranſlates it <hi>ne debatra, ſpes meus non deſceptabit,</hi> my Spirit ſhall not ſtrive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having no regard to the Old Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatours, which <hi>Olivetanus</hi> had ranked in his Margent. There were ſeveral Editions put forth of thoſe Animadverſions of <hi>Jo.

'Tis not long ago ſince <hi>Samuel Deſmarets</hi> a <hi>Calviniſtical Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> at <hi>Groningen,</hi> jumbled all his <hi>notae variorum,</hi> Collections out of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Doctors, and the ſeveral Editions of the Bible into a full Body, whereunto he adjoyned the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva Tranſlation,</hi> A Book publiſhed by Himſelf: Himſelf, I mean a man certainly of no great Judgment, to ſwell up his Book into a <hi>Folio</hi> with a pack of apeleſs and impertinent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. The <hi>French</hi> Bible alſo, which was <hi>Tranſlated</hi> by <hi>Rena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Benedictus,</hi> a <hi>Pariſian</hi> Divine may be thrown in among the Number of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Merchandize; for when he was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his Brother Divines for ſo raſh and inconſiderate an attempt: He proteſted before God and Man, that his <hi>Tranſlation</hi> was the ſame with that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which he altered a little, without ever a Glance upon the Hebrew, which he never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and that he added and ſubſtracted only as his Genius and Fancy led him. The reaſon why this <hi>Divine</hi> turn'd a <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator,</hi> was becauſe that a meer <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in the Greek tongue, had took upon him to <hi>Tranſlate Ariſtotles Logick,</hi> and had got great applauſe by the endeavour, which he looked upon as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident whereby he might be kept harmleſs in going to do the Hebrew and Greek <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> out of their Originals, though he had liv'd always a Stranger to both thoſe Languages. Laſtly, let us place among the <hi>Geneva Bibles</hi> the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of <hi>Johannes Adeodates</hi> a <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Miniſter, which was firſt publiſhed in <hi>Italian</hi> and then in <hi>French,</hi> and is in as much Vogue with the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as the <hi>Geneva Tranſlation</hi> it ſelf.

                     <p>BIBLES have the appellation of <hi>Polyglott</hi> from the ſeveral <hi>Tongues</hi> wherein they are penned. Now the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> are ſaid to have publiſhed two Copies of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, in ſerveral Languages, the firſt whereof gives you the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text, the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſely <hi>Onkeloſius,</hi> the <hi>Targum,</hi> or <hi>Arabic</hi> Paraphraſe by <hi>R. Saadius</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Gaon,</hi> or the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the <hi>Perſian</hi> Verſion by <hi>Tauſus:</hi> The other preſents you with not only the Hebrew Texts and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, but a Tranſlation in the vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> and another in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and both of them writ in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters with the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> points, which ſupply the places of ſo many Vowels. And ſome points may be found both in <hi>R. Saadias</hi> and <hi>Tauſus</hi> his <hi>Perſic</hi> Tranſlation; though it may be worth our while to obſerve that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who pointed <hi>R. Saadias</hi> his Tranſlation, did therein have a greater regard to the vulgar <hi>Arabic</hi> Tranſlation than the true and Grammatical, which may be ſeen by the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and made apparent from theſe firſt words in <hi>Geneſis.</hi>

And I will give you a ſmall Specimen of the Vulgar Greek and Spaniſh Tranſlations, becauſe you cannot meet their true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies in any <hi>Europaean</hi> Libraries, drawing my example from the 6 Verſion of the 1 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Deuteron.</hi> placing the Hebrew as an unprejudiced impartial Arbitrator between the Spaniſh on the on ſide, and the vulgar Greek on the other.</p>

                        </hi> of <hi>Sineros,</hi> Cardinal and Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and was vulgarly called the <hi>Complutenſian</hi> Bible. Here you may take a proſpect of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text, the <hi>ſeptuagint</hi> and a Latin Tranſlation ſuppoſed to be St. <hi>Jeroms,</hi> together with a <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> upon the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch.</hi> Now the reaſon of this Illuſtrious Cardinals attempt is laid down in his Preface to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th. ſince that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Language hath its proverbial proprieties, whoſe full energie may not be expreſſed by the moſt compleat Interpretation, which more eſpecially happens in the Hebrew Tongue, it muſt likewiſe come to paſs that where there is ſo great variety of Latin Books, and ſo many falſe readings, there muſt then an appeal be made to the Original Language, as St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other Eccleſiaſtical Writers are pleaſed to tell us: ſo that the right read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> is to be tryed by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the Hebrew-truth, and thoſe of the New-Teſtament by the <hi>Greek Copies,</hi> and yet in another of his <hi>Prefaces</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> he ſeems to deny the Hebrew verity to recriminate the <hi>Jewiſh Books,</hi> an uſeful method, whereby he might with leſſer difficulty bring in vogue, the Old Tranſlations of the Church; for he declares that when he had placed St. <hi>Jeroms.</hi> Latin Tranſlation between the Greek and Hebrew Tongues, he fancied he beheld our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, or the Catholick Church between two Thieves. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a moſt unworthy ſimilitude, and not fit to come out of the Lips of ſo eminent a Cardinal; touching the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, He ſaith he only publiſhed that part which related to the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as for the remainder upon the reſt of the Old Teſtament, he looked upon it as corrupt, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be bound up with the Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>This is the method obſerved in the <hi>Complutenſian</hi> Bible, and the Author Cardinal <hi>Ximenius</hi> is to be commended, that he did not compoſe a New Tranſlation different from St. <hi>Jeroms,</hi> and yet would certainly have been more applauded if he had taken notice of the places, where the Tranſlatour follows St. <hi>Jerom</hi> a little too hard, and deviates from the Hebrew Text. For truly Criticks go about to remark that St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we have it now, is not all of a make, but hath ſome little mixture of the Ancient or Italian. Herein I quote the moſt Learned Cardinal, that he rectified the faulty Latin Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which yet he had the happineſs to perform in general, namely where he endeavoured to correct the Latin Tranſlator,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50875:114"/>without the help of Latin Books: neither came he well off in reforming the Greek Copies with the Hebrew, though he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly declares he had nothing to do with the Vulgar ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Copies, but the moſt ancient, and leaſt faulty. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Book of the words in the New <hi>Teſtament,</hi> and profeſſes that his ſole aim herein was to preſent the Reader with the bare Letters, only without ſpirit, or tone. He ſaith 'twas an eaſie caſe to mannage, <hi>That the ancient</hi> Greeks <hi>never troubled their heads with ſuch like punctill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi>'s. Now, why he did venture upon the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> after the ſame method, he giveth this reaſon, namely, that it was bare Tranſlation, and not Text, as is the <hi>Greek</hi> Edition of the New <hi>Teſtament.</hi> In fine Cardinal <hi>Ximenius</hi> ſuperadded to theſe his abovementioned works an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, which he did not take up upon truſt at the Shops of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's,</hi> but had it at the beſt hand of the Ancient Interpreters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> at the expences, and by the Authority of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the 2d. King of <hi>Spain</hi> republiſhed the <hi>Complutenſian Polyglot</hi> with no ſmall augmentation, which in proceſs had the ſpacious Title of <hi>Kings Phillips Bible.</hi> A Book, which beſide the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s <hi>Latin Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Complu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſian</hi> Edition gives you a fair proſpect of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe upon the remainder of thoſe Books in the old Copy, which Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Ximenius</hi> gave to the Library at <hi>Complutenſian,</hi> together with the <hi>Syriac Tranſlation</hi> of the New <hi>Teſtament</hi> done into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> Neither would <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> influenced by <hi>Ximenius</hi> his example ſuffer his Book to contract acquaintance with any Tranſlation, ſave that of St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s, and yet that a <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation might not be wanting to render the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text <hi>verbatim,</hi> he inſerted in the end of his Book <hi>San. Pagninus</hi> his <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation, with his own animadverſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> might be better underſtood. This grand elaborate, and princely undertaking tho it was approved of by the Divines of <hi>Spain, Lovaenium,</hi> and other learned and pious Men; nay even by the Univerſal Biſhop himſelf <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. yet it groaned under the common fate of all Books, was carp'd at, and pinched by the men of <hi>Leeth.</hi> Theſe were the detracting ſort of People, who objected that <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> had put in Execution a moſt bold, raſh, and nefarious attempt in daring to publiſh that corrupt, and monſtrous Paraphraſe, which <hi>Ximenius</hi> had ordered to be laid up in the Colledge Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Complutenſia.</hi> And there were ſome <hi>Jews</hi> who thinking
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50875:114"/>that the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe was a great Pillar to keep up the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of their Religions wiſhed all health and happineſs to King <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d. a Defender (as they ſuppoſed) of their Rites and Ceremonies. In the mean time, one <hi>Franciſcus Lucus</hi> of <hi>Bruges,</hi> a great Divine, and a man of vaſt Learning took up the Cudgels ägainſt theſe impertinent Detractors, and made an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe. Beſides <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that Cardinal <hi>Ximenius</hi> himſelf had thoughts of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, and that he had thoughts of adding a <hi>Latin Tranſlation</hi> to it, only putting out the Fables. Doubtleſs that princely Work deſerves to be had in eſtimation with all Divines; though it be defective in ſome particulars, as carrying along with it all thoſe deformities, which we took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of before in the <hi>Conplutenſian Bible.</hi> For the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Copies are the ſame that were publiſhed by Cardinal <hi>Ximenius. Arias Montanus</hi> did not ſo much reform <hi>San. Pagninus</hi> his <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion, as he did corrupt and ſpoil it, for preſſing the <hi>Hebrew</hi> which too cloſely he frequently commits <hi>toto caſu,</hi> and making a great noiſe about a little Senſe, does often miſs of the proper import of the words. Beſides <hi>Arias</hi> cauſed a better method and more Copious <hi>Index</hi> to be publiſhed (as containing more <hi>Lexicons</hi> and <hi>Grammars,</hi> than that of the <hi>Complutenſian Bible,</hi> though many unneceſſary things might be left out, which make nothing for his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The liberal expences of Cardinal <hi>Ximenius</hi> and <hi>Phillip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond were far exceeded by an Eminent Perſon of this Age, <hi>Michael Le Jay</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi> who undertaking to Publiſh the <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glot</hi> Bible at his own charge, ſpent his whole Patrimony in Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, before he had finiſh'd ſo great and wonderful a work.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then they took care to have all that was already extant in the King's Bible, reprinted in a fairer Character; and to theſe he joyn'd the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Books (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hebrew Samaritan Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch</hi> with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Tranſlation) and the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Verſions of the Old Teſtament diſtinguiſhed by points, with their <hi>Latin</hi> Interpretation: a thing ſcarce credible ever to have been attempted. In this buſineſs he was aſſiſted by a very Learned man, <hi>Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> that came from Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> in the <hi>Holy-Land;</hi> and in ſome few Volumns, by <hi>Abraham</hi> an <hi>Ecchellenſian,</hi> one of the ſame Nation. But that part, which contains the obſervations of ſeveral worthy men upon the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50875:115"/>Editions of the Bible, is wanting in this work: and through the negligence of thoſe that were intruſted with it, it happen'd that the Copies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation by the <hi>Seventy</hi> Interpreters, and the <hi>Latin</hi> one by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> were both compoſed anew the very ſame with thoſe in the Kings Bible; the <hi>Greek</hi> Edition after the <hi>Vatican</hi> Pattern, though corrected and amended, was omitted, and the Copies of the common Edition were laid aſide, though they had been (by Commiſſions from the Popes) ſtrictly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the moſt ancient and beſt approved Books, and that by the Hands of ſeveral Excellent Perſons and judicious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. However I paſs by thoſe faults, which occaſioned by the Tranſcribers overſight in the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Books, do yet in great part remain: Beſides that the <hi>Latin</hi> Expoſitors not perfectly underſtanding the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> words, have often ſailed in expreſſing the ſence.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, to this vaſt Work are perfixed certain Prefaces which recommend it's uſefulneſs. But in this the brave Mr. <hi>Le Jay</hi> proves his own Enemy: for depending totally upon ſuch men as were partly byaſs'd in their Opinions by prejudice (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>John Morin,</hi> otherwiſe a man of competent Learning) he extolls the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books, and ſticks not to prefer them before the ancient Tranſlations of the Church: but what ſeems ſcarce 0 credible, he poſſitively aſſerts, that it ought to be granted as a certain and undoubted truth, that, that common Edition which paſſes about in the vulgar Tongue of the Catholick Church, is the true and genuine Original of Holy Scripture. But the Fathers themſelves at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> durſt not paſs any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree concerning the <hi>Latin</hi> Books. To no purpoſe has that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Gentleman drained his Purſe in Publiſhing ſuch volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous peices of the <hi>Polyglot</hi> Bible, if it appear that the <hi>Latin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the proper and Primitive Scripture, and that we muſt have recourſe to him as the true Fountain. In like manner vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the interpretation of the <hi>Seventy</hi> Elders, he draws an Argument (ſolid enough in his Judgment) from a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Author, who, as to matter of Chronology rejected the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Books of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and adhered to the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters: from whence Mr. <hi>Le Jay</hi> concludes, that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi> Interpreters were in the higheſt eſteem, not only amongſt the Chriſtians but <hi>Mahometans</hi> too. Indeed 'tis very probable that Mr. <hi>Le Jay,</hi> to credit the antiquity of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50875:115"/>which he himſelf firſt publiſhed, would not ſtick to ſay that by the help thereof St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had reſtored the ſeven or eight hundred Verſes of <hi>Job,</hi> which were lacking in the old Tranſlation: and this his aſſertion he confirms by St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s own Teſtimony; who before his Tranſlation of the Book of <hi>Job</hi> had premiſed, that in it were miſſing about ſeven or eight hundred Verſes, and that in compiling it he had not followed any of the ancient Tranſlators, but had collected ſometimes the words, ſometimes the ſence, and often both at once, out of the <hi>Hebrew, Arabick</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Syriack</hi> Languages. But that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> hereby mentioning the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue did not mean the <hi>Arabick</hi> Verſion, is a thing ſo well known, that it needs no proof, theſe words of the Learned Father ſignify no more, than that the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> was difficult to be underſtood, ſince the Author thereof had notonly uſed <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, but alſo <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick.</hi> For the better underſtanding of which he avers, that with a great ſum he ranſom'd a certain Maſter called <hi>Lydaeus,</hi> who was thought to be of great repute amongſt the <hi>Hebrecians.</hi> Scarce had the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Bibles got abroad, when in <hi>England</hi> the famous <hi>Walton</hi> and other divers perſons begun to think of committing theſe ſame Bibles to the Preſs again, to be of leſs bulk, and not ſo large a Letter; that this New Edition of the <hi>Polyglots</hi> might be readier and more convenient for the uſe of ſuch as ſtudied the holy Scriptures. This matter ſucceeded as happily as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; ſo that theſe <hi>Polyglot</hi> Bibles appeared in publick in the year 1657, and are vulgarly called the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix Volums. They are indeed much inferiour to the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Heptaglots</hi> in the largeneſs and goodneſs of the Paper, as alſo the neatneſs of the Character; But they have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage chiefly, that every context and verſion may be diſcerned by the Reader in one ſingle glance as it were, and with little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compared one with another, which cannot be done in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Pariſian Polyglot,</hi> without turning over two vaſt huge Volumns together. Again they are to be preferred before that of <hi>Paris,</hi> in that they contain truer Copies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> one by St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> being firſt borrowed from a <hi>Vatican</hi> Book at <hi>Rome,</hi> was afterwards Printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> purged from innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Errours by the Study and Authority of <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the Fifth and <hi>Clement the</hi> Eight. Beſides all this you have the <hi>Arabick,</hi>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:50875:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>and <hi>Syriack</hi> Tranſlations of <hi>Eſter, Judith, Tobias,</hi> and ſome other few Books which are not extant in the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Bible ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Arabick</hi> or <hi>Syriack.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Edition has likewiſe a threefold Paraphraſe, one called the <hi>Hieroſolymitan,</hi> another that of <hi>Pſcado Jonathan</hi> (both which are writ in mixt <hi>Chaldee,</hi>) and a third <hi>Tauſus</hi> his <hi>Perſian</hi> Paraphraſe. It has alſo the four Goſpels in the <hi>Perſian</hi> and a <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pſalter, all which the <hi>Pariſian Polyglots</hi> want.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time Monſieur <hi>Le Jay</hi> having conſumed his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in publiſhing the <hi>Paris</hi> Bibles complains much of his ſad Fortune, and inveighs againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, as <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> who had taken his Work out of his hands, and had publiſhed nothing (except ſome few things of very little importance) but what he had ſet forth before. Truly the Gentleman ought to be pitied who had laviſhly waſted all his ſubſtance in hopes of future gain. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men in publiſhing ſuch <hi>Polyglots,</hi> as are more convenient, and better ſuited to all neceſſities do really deſerve Commendation; and had deſerved it much more if they had ſet out the Verſions of the Oriental Nations (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Arabic</hi>) which lay dorment in their Libraries; and are of better note than thoſe which were publiſhed in the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Bibles. For it had been much better to have ſet forth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the <hi>Arabic Pentateuch,</hi> with the <hi>Obelisks, Asterisks,</hi> and others of <hi>Origen</hi> his Notes which are reſerved in the Library at <hi>Oxon,</hi> than to have compoſed anew that Old patched Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe of <hi>R. Saadias,</hi> which was extant before in the <hi>Pariſian Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglots.</hi> But what ſeems more ſtrange, is that the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of faults which the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Edition is ſtuff'd with, eſpecially in the <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> Verſions, as alſo in their <hi>Latin</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, ſhould yet be found in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one, nor taken notice in the critical Animadverſions made upon the laſt <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Author of the <hi>Critica Sacra</hi> upon the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had beſpoken Moderation in <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> whom he look'd upon as a Perſon carried away with too great an affectation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion. But the Learned Gentleman who well underſtood <hi>that Chriſt in the</hi> Apocalyps <hi>had ſpu'd the Lukewarm out of his mouth, and that God loves nothing that halts between two Mediums,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Reſp. ad obj. nup. Critic.</note> fell more obſtinately to work when he ſet himſelf to write his ſmall Treatiſe concering the Oracles of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> wherein he ſeems to have argued to that one thing alone, the advancement of the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters by applauding, according to his common Cuſtom, the Exemplars of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For he returns his anſwer to <hi>Simon</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if he had addreſs'd himſelf in his work with a Mind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> after the Example of St. <hi>Jerom, who was the firſt of the Chriſtians who fram'd a Rabbinic Verſion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ncouraged others to dare the ſame. Voſſius</hi> makes large Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he does not follow the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and that he acquieſces in that Verſion which Chriſt himſelf approv'd; and admoniſhes <hi>Simon</hi> to forbear from any new Tranſlation of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in regard a purer and more genuine Verſion cannot be
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50875:118"/>made, then that which was recommended to us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And ſo far indeed <hi>Voſſius</hi> does well in attributing very much to the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlators; though he would have done much better, had he not affirmed them to be altogether free from all manner of Error, and that they were not to be ſwerv'd from in matters of ſmalleſt moment, as they who were to be lookt upon as Prophets rather then Interpreters. I alſo extol the diligence of that worthy Perſon, in vindicating the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the <hi>Seventy</hi> Interpreters from the calumnies of moſt ſlanderous perſons, and for correcting their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts. But when he comes to diſcourſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Books, the Learned Gentleman diſcovers a world of ignorance in thoſe things, and frequently endeavours to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe falſhood for truth. All which ſhall be made apparent by Examples. To which purpoſe I ſhall ſelect ſome things out of that famous Perſons Treatiſe concerning the Oracles of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> and his anſwer to the Objections of the <hi>Critica Sacra:</hi> from whence it will appear that he has given poſitive ſentence in matters which he little underſtood, I will therefore begin from the Epiſtle which he has affix'd to that little diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt daſh, in this Epiſtle <hi>Voſſius</hi> takes ſeveral occaſions to traduce the perſon himſelf, as learned as he was in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Language, for <hi>a Fool,</hi> a <hi>half Rabbie,</hi> and an <hi>Egregious Knave,</hi> as one that produc'd the words of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly dreſs'd and trim'd for his own turn.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.33.</note> The place in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is extant in theſe words in St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> Hebrew Queſtions, upon <hi>Geneſis. The</hi> Hebrews, <hi>as to what follows.</hi> And he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd not when ſhe lay down nor when ſhe roſe up, <hi>marke the words at the top, as a thing incredible, and as a thing not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in nature how a Man ſhould lye with a Woman and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand any thing of it. Voſſius</hi> atteſts, that he has conſulted many Manuſcript Copies, and that he finds it written in all <hi>Apponunt,</hi> not <hi>Appungunt; they ſet over or upon,</hi> inſtead of, they mark with points at the top. He would have ſaid truer that he never found <hi>Apponunt</hi> in any Manuſcripts that were of credit or reputation, for what ſence could be made of theſe words had <hi>Apponunt</hi> been ſet in the place of <hi>Appungunt.</hi> Nor does he tell us where he found theſe Manuſcripts. But that we may come to the buſineſs, there was no reaſon for <hi>Voſſius</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the words of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, fearing perhaps, leaſt from
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50875:118"/>that word <hi>Appungunt,</hi> the Antiquity of points might be made out from St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> time. For the ſounder ſort of Criticks confeſs that thoſe points were much later then the age wherein St. <hi>Jerom</hi> liv'd; who nevertheleſs acknowledge, that that ſort of points, of which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> here makes mention, and which are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome words of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context, were done upon the ſame ground that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Syrians</hi> fix certain croſs ſtroaks over ſome words which were invented by the Grammarians or Criticks. And the <hi>Jews</hi> both Ancient and Modern agree with St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in this particular. Mention is alſo made of theſe points, in the <hi>Talmud</hi> in <hi>Medraſchim,</hi> or the Allegoricall Comments of the <hi>Jews</hi> upon Scripture. And they are likewiſe to be ſeen in the Modern Exemplars of the Bibles; and in moſt, upon the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>one of the fifteen Points which are in the Law.</hi> Now as for the reaſons which are given for theſe Points by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are troubl'd with an Itch of vanity, I paſs them by in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as being very frivolous. It is enough to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that the <hi>Jews</hi> retain thoſe Points in their Exemplars by Tradition from their Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Voſſius</hi> in his Epiſtle deplores the miſerable Eſtate of the Accademies in <hi>Germany</hi> at this day, where <hi>Rabbiniſme</hi> domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers without controul, and no Theology but <hi>Rabbinical</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd. The Learned Gentleman does not believe that human Learning can be taught or ſtudyed where <hi>Rabbiniſm</hi> raigns, and the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Screitch-Owls bear an ominous ſway. Nor do I diſſent from <hi>Voſſius</hi> in this particular. And I would be glad thoſe pedling Prieſts might be expung'd out of the number of Divines, who contemning the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Learning, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of nothing but the Fictions of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> But that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eminently Learned, who after the Example of <hi>Origen, Jerom, Chryſoſtom, Theodoret</hi> and others of the Fathers frequent the Threſholds of the <hi>Jews.</hi> ſhould be liſted in their Number I can hardly endure. For though generally the greateſt part of the Books of the <hi>Jews</hi> are full of frivilous Trifles, yet there
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50875:119"/>are not a few of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> who have wonderfully illuſtrated Sacred Scripture. And this the Commentaries of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> alone upon the Peophets aparently make out, who was not aſhamed to conſult the moſt Learned <hi>Jews</hi> of his Age. But to the nice and ſqueamiſh Mr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems contemptible and Prince of the <hi>Semi-Rabbinical</hi> Divines. And that <hi>Semi-Rabbie</hi> as he calls him, though he have his failings, has far ſurpaſs'd all the reſt of the Fathers of the Church in expounding the Books of Sacred Scripture. And I could wiſh alſo that <hi>Voſſius</hi> had firſt convers'd with thoſe half <hi>Rabbins,</hi> before he began to meddle with their concerns For thoſe half <hi>Rabbies</hi> can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Laughter when they read in his Epiſtle before his Treatiſe of the Oracles of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> that it is not above ſix Centuries ſince thoſe Vowel points came to be us'd with which the Modern Exemplars of the <hi>Jews</hi> are loaded; That three or four Ages moſt fiercely contended together, while theſe were of Opinion that the Vowels were thus, others another way to be introduc'd: And that the Controverſie would never have been at an end, unleſs <hi>Daniel Bomberg</hi> had ended the quarrel, having had ſome Centuries of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo thoſe Vowels crept into the World out of <hi>Bombergs</hi> Shop in <hi>Venice.</hi> That perſon, 'tis true, had a Library well furniſh'd with <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Books, from whence he gathered moſt of his Fictions more <hi>Rabbinical.</hi> But they who have convers'd with Books of the <hi>Jews,</hi> well know, that before <hi>Bombergs</hi> Edition of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, and in other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Peſaro,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles were then Printed with pointed Vowels. We alſo meet with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Bibles in Manuſcript written above four hundred years ſince, which have the ſame Points; and Bibles are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the more antient <hi>Rabbies</hi> wherein the ſame Points are made uſe of. And it is plain, that theſe Points were in uſe not only for ſix, but for nine hundred years ago. For the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie <hi>Saadas Gaon</hi> wrote a Grammer about the Year DCCC. wherein he diſputes at large about the pointed Vowels, which were in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> long before his time. Beſides thoſe things are all feigned that <hi>Voſſius</hi> affirms concerning the ſoare contention among the <hi>Jews,</hi> how the Vowels are to be placed upon the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context. And of the ſame ſtamp is that which the Learned Gentleman urges concerning the Editions of <hi>Bomberg,</hi> which according to the Opinions of the <hi>Jews</hi> are full
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50875:119"/>of Faults. And indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> contemn the firſt Edition of <hi>Bomborgh,</hi> which was overlook'd by <hi>Felix Patrenſis,</hi> in regard the <hi>Maſoretis</hi> Notes are very unskilfully added to the Margent of that Exemplar; but they applaud and reverence the ſecond and third of <hi>Bombergh's</hi> Editions.</p>
                  <p>In the adding the <hi>Mazoretic</hi> notes to <hi>Bomberghs</hi> Editions great difficulties aroſe; for that there are few among the Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies that truly underſtand the <hi>Maſoretic</hi> Art, which however <hi>R. Jacob Ben Hajim</hi> with inceſſant toyl and labour over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, the firſt reſtorer of the <hi>Maſora.</hi> But whether he waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Patrimony in maintaining thoſe Centuries that <hi>Bombergh</hi> hir'd, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> eagerly contends, I ſhall neither ſollicitouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, neither is it to the purpoſe. Much more might be added to what I have already produc'd, and perhaps proper enough to the buſineſs; but I am afraid leaſt the learned Gentleman ſhould bring me to the Bar, for a Semi Rabby and a Favourer of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Therefore let us come to the Examination of his little Treatiſe concerning the Oracles of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> where he diſputes more learnedly of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Books.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of his diſcourſe, this Perſon of an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Erudition, produces ſome things in reference to the Oracles of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> more eſpecially in <hi>Spain</hi> made uſe of againſt the Chriſtians. And as for thoſe things which ſeem to be more remote from Truth then Fiction, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to <hi>p.</hi> 19 or 26. where he handles that Argument; but ſeeing that it has already been demonſtrared, that the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy fetch'd from the Books of the <hi>Jews,</hi> leſs favours the <hi>Jews</hi> than that which is taken out from the Greek Tranſlators, there is no reaſon we ſhould ſpend any more time in rifling the Inventions of the moſt learned <hi>Voſſius.</hi> The qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But in this place, more perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious then before, he believes that the ſpace of that Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may be Comprehended within the limits of two and twenty Years at moſt, and this he gathers from the words of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philadelphians.</hi> That moſt Holy Martyr, according to the report of <hi>Voſſius;</hi> relates that he heard ſome ſay, that if thoſe things which are contained in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50875:120"/>were not to be found in the Ancient Monuments, he would not believe them. Now, ſaith <hi>Voſſius,</hi> ſince he anſwered and they denied, it is manifeſt that the <hi>Jews</hi> had deprav'd the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars, or ſwerved from the Senſe of the 70 Interpreters.

                     <hi>I have heard ſome ſay, that unleſs I find the Goſpel in the Ancient Monuments, I will not believe. To theſe I anſwer, that Jeſus Chriſt is to me inſtead of the Ancient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But there the diſcourſe is not of the Old Teſtament compared with the New, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> believ'd, but of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks which ſpringing up in the Infancy of the Church, denied the Faith which the Exemplar of the Goſpel ſet forth. Whence it came to paſs that the Ancient Fathers of the Church. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Ireneus</hi> and others of the ſame rank, did not undertake to refute the Hereticks out of the ſacred Scripture, but from certain Tradition, or from the Doctrine of Chriſt, propagated by the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, Apoſtolick Perſons, in the Churches of ſeveral Nations. In which ſenſe <hi>Ignatius</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts that Chriſt or his Doctrine was to him in the place of the Ancient Monuments. This, unleſs I am very much deceived, is the meaning of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s words, who commends Unity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in Chriſt, whoſe Spirit ought to be preferred before any Ancient Monuments whatever.</p>

                     <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by them alſo call'd <hi>Haggar. When the Jews,</hi> ſaith <hi>Voſſius, believed that their</hi> Meſſiah <hi>ſhould be a Stranger.</hi> But theſe things are little remote from the Fictions of the Rabbies. In the next place, I would fain know from what Oracle of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bills</hi> the Learned Gentleman gather'd; that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> and a <hi>Stranger,</hi> according to the true opinion of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for that this Aſſertion is contrary to the <hi>Propheſies</hi> of the Prophets and all Evangelical Hiſtory, as all Men well know. Certainly the <hi>Jews</hi> expect one <hi>Meſſiah</hi> above all the reſt, of whom <hi>Voſſius</hi> diſcourſes at preſent; but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common conſent of all the <hi>Jews</hi> is expected to be of the Nation, and one of the Tribes of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But they expect other <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s beſides, and for that reaſon they give that Title to ſome Kings who were well affected towards them. And therefore <hi>Cyrus</hi> is call'd the <hi>Meſſia</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> might have the Title of <hi>Meſſiah</hi> from the <hi>Jews.</hi> And in our age they are ready to ſalute that Prince or King, whoever he be, with the Title of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that will but take into his protection their Affairs and the Ceremonies of their Country. But theſe things belong nothing at all to the word <hi>Heriga,</hi> which moſt certainly is an <hi>Arabic</hi> and not an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word. Much nearer does that come to the Truth, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome things thrown between, the Learned Gentleman adds concerning the Genuine ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">

But who can then gather with <hi>Voſſius,</hi> that the Books of the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> that according to his Sentiments, were formerly added by the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> to the Books of the Old Teſtament, were worthy to be reckon'd as Canonical with the reſt of the Prophetick Books, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Canonical Scripture, both of the Synagogue and Church, is maim'd and lame, while the Books of <hi>Enoch, Elias</hi> and ſome others are left out? Prophets are become very Cheap with <hi>Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> who not only numbers the 70 Interpreters among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but alſo the moſt famous Impoſtors, who taking upon them the names of the Patriarchs and Prophets and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of high ſame and repute among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> have Printed the Books of <hi>Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Moſes, Eſaiah, Jeremiah, Hyſtaſpes, Mercurius, Trimegiſtus, Zoroaſter,</hi> the <hi>Sybils, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus, Phocilldes</hi> and ſeveral others. In a ſhort time, if it ſo
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50875:121"/>pleaſe the Heavens, we ſhall have <hi>Voſſius</hi> himſelf in the midſt of his Prophetick Chiurme, forging new Propheſies, like that ſame famous Impoſter <hi>William Poſtellus,</hi> who writes that the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> had the true Doctrine reveal'd to them under the firſt Monarchy, and that it was continually renew'd like the ſacred Doctrine by the ten <hi>Sybils,</hi> that the world might be inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the Spirit of God; and that Chriſt, the King both of the Sacred and the <hi>Sibelline</hi> Doctrines might be known to be the Deity, that was to be ador'd by the whole World. Such Stories as theſe <hi>Voſſius</hi> produces concerning the Oracles of the <hi>Sybills.</hi> But <hi>Poſtellus,</hi> yet more quickſighted, aſſerts this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Doctrine to have had its Original from a Woman who was Princeſs of all the Eaſt, and next of kin to <hi>Noah.</hi> Who would believe that <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> who ſpares for no virulent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and their <hi>Talmud,</hi> ſhould introduce a <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudic</hi> Doctor among the Prophets; if it be ſo, I wonder he ſhould be in ſuch a fury againſt a Perſon, Learned in the Hebrew, who expounded the Goſpel out of the <hi>Talmud.</hi>

                  <p>I call the <hi>Apocriphal</hi> Books, when we diſcourſe of Byblick concerns, thoſe which neither the Church nor the Synagogue has received as Canonical.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50875:121"/>Writer; others feigned two <hi>Daniels,</hi> one the Author of the Propheſie that goes under his name, and the other the Writer of the Story of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> which in the ancient Editions of the Greek Exemplar was placed before the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel.</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> indeed was the firſt that tranſpoſed it at the end of the ſame Propheſie, becauſe it was not in the Jewiſh Exemplar, which he tranſlated. And St. <hi>Jerom</hi> confirms his opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> by the Teſtimony of other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>I wonder,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That certain peeviſh, waſpiſh perſons are in wrath with me, as if I had cut of part of the Book; whereas Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Euſebius, Apollinarius and other Ecleſiaſticall Perſons and Doctors of Greece confeſs thoſe Viſions not to be found among the Hebrews; not that they ought to be anſwerable to Porphyrius for thoſe things which afford no Authority of ſacred Scripture. Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen, Melito</hi> of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Synopſis,</hi> which goes about under the Name of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> went farther, and put the Book of <hi>Eſther</hi> among the Apocryphal Books, meerly becauſe not underſtanding the Hebrew Tongue, they found ſome pieces added to the Ancient Hiſtory of <hi>Eſther</hi> by a Greek Author, for which reaſon they condemn'd the whole Work. <hi>It happened,</hi> ſaith Sextus Senenſis, <hi>that by reaſon of thoſe frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Appendex</hi>'s <hi>inſerted here and there, through the raſhneſs of ſome Writers, that Book, though written in the Hebrew, did not find reception among the Chriſtians. Nicholas de Lyra,</hi> alſo <hi>Cajetan</hi> and ſome others denyed theſe Additions likewiſe to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, induc'd as it is moſt probable by the ſame reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things have been diſcourſed more at large, that it might appear to all what Books were reckon'd to be <hi>Apocriphal</hi> in the Judgment of the more Antient Fathers. But <hi>Voſſius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the word <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> introduces ſuppoſitious and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Books, inſtead of the Old Apocryphal, and ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon the ſimple and unwary. For whereas he endeavours to make it out, that the Books of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> and others which he calls <hi>Fatidical,</hi> were joyned with the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, read in the Primitive Church, and recommended by the Apoſtles, it is the Fiction of one that has nothing to do but to ſit and Romance in Divinity. For there were no other Books read in the Primitive Church, or added to the reſt of the Books of the Old Teſtament, in the Greek Exemplars of the Bible, than thoſe which are mentioned by the Fathers. Though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50875:122"/>ſome of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they might preſs the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> more home, have ſometimes quoted the Books of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> and others of the ſame ſtamp, which nevertheleſs no ingenious perſon will reckon among the Apocryphal Books, of which we are now in diſcourſe. <hi>Voſſius</hi> is very much griev'd that the Books of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> and other Sooth-ſayer's Books, after they were prohibited by publick Edict, were made <hi>Apocryphal</hi> and forbid to be read by any Perſon, when formerly they were openly and religiouſly made uſe of by the <hi>Jews,</hi> like the reſt of the Books of the Old Teſtament; whence it came to paſs that the Canonical Books were reduced to a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number, and the word <hi>Apocryphal</hi> was taken in an evil ſenſe, for ſpurious and of doubtful and ſuſpected Credit.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time he never cites the Authour from whence he drew theſe witty conceits, which are ſo like the Fables of the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo that I may preſume to ask this Learned Perſon what the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Cardinal <hi>Hyppolito d'eſte</hi> demanded of <hi>Areoſto Dove hatro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vato tante cogloonare. Where did he find out ſo many jugling Tricks?</hi> But I agree with him in what he writes concerning the Apocriphal Books, if by them he mean no other then thoſe which paſſed from the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Chriſtians, with the reſt of the Books of the Old Teſtament; for that the greateſt part of them are read in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, eſpecially ſince the decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as Canonical, for indeed it might be that thoſe Books which were formerly rejected as Apocriphal, becauſe they were not approv'd by the <hi>Cannon</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> might have had Prophets for their Authors. Nor is the Authority of <hi>Joſephus</hi> contrary to this opinion, who affirms, that from the times of <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> there was no certain Succeſſion of the Prophets, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that theſe Books which were reckon'd after that, were not to be accounted Cononical. Nor is it probable that the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Prophets was altogether taken away at that time from the <hi>Jews;</hi> for while the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> continu'd, there were publick <hi>Scribes</hi> who committed to writing the Affairs of the Nation, and they were called Prophets, becauſe they were inſpir'd with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> though they did not Propheſie of things to come. However it is not neceſſary to believe, that they who wrote the publick Affairs of the Nation at that time, ſhould be Prophets; for that the Senators of the Grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who as we know were inſpired, overlook'd their works,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50875:122"/>but ſeeing that the publick Authority of the Jewiſh Senate, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Regiſter'd thoſe Books among the Canonical, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that moſt of the Fathers would not receive them as Divine, but only as Apocryphal and of ſuſpected credit, eſpecially in reſpect of thoſe other Books which were allowed to be of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Reputation. For that Book which was of ſuſpected Credit, was not the ſame with them, as that which was ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, adulterate, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſeems to think, only under this Title they diſtinguiſh certain from uncertain; otherwiſe thoſe Books had ne'r been read in the ancient Ages of our Forefathers, had they apprehended any thing ſpurious and adulterate in them. Only they were of leſs moment then the ſacred Books, and therefore the Fathers call'd them rather Eccleſiaſtical than Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They would have them read in the Churches,</hi> ſaies the Author of the Expoſition of the Creed attributed to <hi>Rufinus, but not to be Cited as Authentick Confirmations of Faith,</hi> and only upon thoſe Grounds it is that the Church of <hi>England</hi> reads thoſe Books in their Congregations, yet I doe not beleive, that ever any one here except <hi>Voſſius</hi> ever dreamt of introducing the Books of the <hi>Sybills</hi> to be read in the Church.</p>
                  <p>I know indeed, that ſome of the Fathers have in great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration the Book which is called the Preacher, and that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> endeavour'd to obtrude the Book of <hi>Enoch</hi> as of Divine Authority, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo earneſtly laboured to remove ſeveral Books from the ſacred Context, which illuſtrated the Chriſtian Religion. To which opinion alſo <hi>Origen</hi> ſeem'd to adhere, who in the Epiſtle which he wrote to <hi>Africanus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> aſſerts, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn ſeveral paſſages out of their Bibles, to prevent their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read by the common People. But theſe things and others of the ſame Nature, which are own'd but by a few, and which are produc'd rather to ſupport their own opinions than to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Truth, are not to be look't upon as the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers; For <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf ſeems to confirm that common ſentence of the Church, by his own words in this place, <hi>The Book of</hi> Enoch <hi>is not admitted by ſome, becauſe it is not admitted into the Collection of the</hi> Jews. Therefore in thoſe days it was adjudg'd Apocryphal, becauſe it was not admitted among the Canonical Number of the <hi>Jews; Origen</hi> alſo thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50875:123"/>in other places than what he wrote to <hi>Affricanus.</hi> But in this place he could not defend the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Additions in the Greek Edition of the 70 Interpreters, by any other means than by having recourſe to the Apocryphal Books, and ſuppoſing that the <hi>Jews</hi> in Tranſcribing their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, concealed many things from the knowledge of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſort, which were ſet down in thoſe Apocryphal Books. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> perhaps had learn't from the <hi>Jews,</hi> with whom he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Converſant, that <hi>Eſdars</hi> and his Companions did not ſuffer all the Books which were extant to go abroad, and hence he preſumed it might be inferred, that the Greek Interpreters had taken thoſe things which are not to be found in the Hebrew Copies. But this opinion does not agree with the General con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Ancient Jews, who have acknowledged a perfect and acurate Concord of the Hebrew Text in all things. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it ſeem to have been invented by <hi>Origen</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for any other reaſon, but that the Hebrew Truth might be reconciled to the Greek Exemplars, of whoſe Syncerity there was ſufficient reaſon to doubt. To this we may add, that <hi>Origen</hi> in this Epiſtle to <hi>Africanus,</hi> did not ſpeak ſo much his own Sentiments, but only that he might defend the Books which were then read in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> objects, that a perſon of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Erudition, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> writes, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> referr'd to the Oracles of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> and the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of <hi>Hyſtaſpes,</hi> and recommended them to be read. But if it ſhould be enquired of <hi>Voſſius,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid this, he preſently anſwers, that it ought to be ſufficient for us that <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus,</hi> a Holy Perſon, and Converſant with many Apoſtolick Perſons, affirmed it for Truth, but if any regard be had to that Anſwer, of neceſſity it follows that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, were free from all Errour, then which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more abſurdly Fictitious. For they know well, who have any knowledge of Eccleſiaſtial Affairs, how craftily thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers and <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the firſt place, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles. Voſſius</hi> alſo earneſtly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the Book of <hi>Enoch</hi> and other ſuch Books, are not to be rejected for that reaſon only, becauſe that many Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Magical Fragments are contained in ſome Fragments that are extant, ſeeing that <hi>Balaam</hi> was a Magician and Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50875:123"/>yet manifeſtly foretold many future Myſteries concerning Chriſt; as if thoſe things which are regiſter'd in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Balaam,</hi> could be wreſted to the preſent Argument; or that it were lawful by this Example to defend and juſtifie thoſe Books which we find not only to be ſtuft with Lies and Superſtitious Fables, but to be written by Impoſtors, aſſuming to themſelves the Names of famous Men. By the ſame Art the Dreams of the Feavouriſh Jews are maintained in <hi>Midras, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har</hi> and <hi>Rabboth</hi> to be inſpired by the ſame Spirit from whence the Goſpel proceeded, as <hi>William Poſtellus</hi> declares,<note place="margin">De <hi>Orig.</hi> cap 17.</note> who did not ſcruple to affirm that the Goſpel was produc'd from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Zohar,</hi> as that <hi>which had its riſe from the Holy Ghoſt and Spiritual Authors.</hi> The <hi>Chalans</hi> alſo ſaith the ſame, <hi>Poſtellus</hi> the <hi>Syrian, Indian, Caldaean Magicians,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian Gymnoſophiſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> are from the ſame Original, from whom the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſeems not much to ſwerve; whom I would adviſe to place among the number of <hi>Soothſayers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib.

But leaving theſe things, let us proſecute our intended Subject.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, what has been hitherto alledg'd concerning the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Books, we are to obſerve that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not only frame to themſelves a Canon of Scripture, but that the Church has alſo her Canon, who by her own Authority has reſtor'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books which the <hi>Jews</hi> expung'd. Thus St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſerts, that the Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> were not received by the Jews but by the Church for Canonical,<note place="margin">Lib. 18. <hi>de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.

To which opinion St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems to adhere; though frequently in his works he ſhews himſelf a moſt ſtout defender of the <hi>Judaick</hi> Canon. For when <hi>Ruffinus</hi> objects,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> Apoll. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus Rufus.</note> that <hi>Jerom</hi> in his own Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bible, would allow no Authority of Scripture to the <hi>Story of Suſanna,</hi> the <hi>Song of the three Children,</hi> and the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Bell and the Dragon,</hi> which he had called Fables; the learned Father anſwers, that he did not ſpeak his own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but only explain'd what the Jews were wont to urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians, but <hi>Jerom</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>Origen, Euſebius, Apollinarius</hi> and other Doctors of <hi>Greece,</hi> would make no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

But what thoſe <hi>Hagiographers</hi> of the Jews that were mentioned by St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in theſe places, <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> confeſſes he does not underſtand; becauſe the <hi>Hagiographies</hi> were received by the <hi>Jews</hi> into the Canon of Holy Scripture, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Jerom</hi> liv'd. But <hi>Huetius</hi> believes St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in this particular in that he thought the <hi>Jews</hi> had no <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giographies</hi> without the pale of the Canon; and he brings againſt <hi>Scaliger</hi> the famous <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> or the <hi>Daughter of the voice,</hi> by whoſe aſſiſtance the Jews ſet forth their <hi>Hagiographies</hi> and their inſpir'd Scripture. But they are the meer dreams of idle tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers, which the Circumciſed Doctors have invented concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Bath Kol.</hi> Then it is certain that they never receiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Canonical Authors, the Books of <hi>Judith</hi> and <hi>Tobias.</hi> Therefore they are all fictions, which <hi>Huetius</hi> and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg concerning the twofold ſort of <hi>Hagiographers</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and they may be refuted not only by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> who poſitively witneſs that <hi>Tobias, Judith</hi> and other Books ſet forth in <hi>Greek</hi> now comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Canon of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were never reckon'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> among the Prophets or <hi>Hagiographers,</hi> but alſo by the Authority of the more Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> who when they number up the Sacred Books, make no mention of them at all; but only cite them as ſententious Writings, wherein however they did not believe there was any thing of Divine Inſpiration. If therefore in this our Age, nay in the ancient Ages of the Church, they were numbred among the Canonical Books, that is to be attributed to the Judgment of the Church, and not of the Synagogue. Therefore there is a double Canon
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50875:124"/>to be allowed, that of the Church, and that of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. And by the firſt Rule, they may not erroneouſly be called Eccleſiaſtic Books, which the Church, taking no notice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Canon, have thought fit to admit into their Canon, and to be read in their Congregations. For it is certain that even from the very firſt Infancy of the Church, theſe Books were accuſtom'd to be read and ſung in the Congregations of the Faithful, which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> admires to hear ſo frequently ſung and read in Churches at this day.

                     <hi>Tobias,</hi> ſaith the Learned Father, <hi>which the</hi> Hebrews <hi>pruning off from the Catalogue of Divine Scripture, have condemn'd among thoſe which they call Hagiographa.</hi> Who does
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50875:125"/>not preſently apprehend from hence that the word ought to be read <hi>Apocripha,</hi> not <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> ſince it is apparently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the <hi>Jews</hi> never cut of the <hi>Hagiography</hi> from the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Divine Scripture. The ſame obſervation is to be made in the Preface of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> upon <hi>Judith,</hi> where inſtead of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giographa</hi> it ought to be read <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> For thus the words run at this day. <hi>Among the</hi> Hebrews <hi>the Books of Judith is reckon'd among the</hi> Hagiographa, <hi>whoſe authority is not ſo ſufficient to ſtrengthen the convincement of thoſe things which give occaſion of diſpute.</hi> If the authority of that Book be not ſufficient to confirm our Faith, certainly it can be none of the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> which without Controverſie are accounted Canonical and inſpir'd among the <hi>Jews;</hi> but of the number of the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which are of dubious and uncertain Credit, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> thought the Books of <hi>Judith</hi> and <hi>Tobias</hi> to be. Thus much concerning the Apocryphal Books, upon which we have inſiſted longer then the purpoſe of our Subject required. But we did not think it a deviation from our Argument to unfold a Diſpute highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagu'd by the Contentions of the Diſputants.</p>
                  <p>But now it was not enough for the moſt Learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> to have feign'd new Prophets much more quick ſighted then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ones, but he muſt now produce a new Order of the Books of Sacred Scripture hither to unheard of. The Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to his own Opinion, make five Volums and not one, as the <hi>Jews</hi> believe: and to prevent any man from calling this in queſtion, he produces moſt convincing reaſon's for this new Diſtrubution. <hi>For it is manifeſt;</hi> ſaith He, <hi>even out of the Sacred Writings themſelves, that as other Nations, ſo alſo the ancient</hi> Jews <hi>wrote their Books not upon folded Paper, which is a modern Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in rolls and continued Skins:</hi> What reaſon there was for <hi>Voſſius</hi> to have recourſe to the Antient <hi>Hebrews</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, when even in our times, the <hi>Jews</hi> make uſe of Rolls of the ſame nature, as to the Books which they make uſe of in their Synagogues; yet for all that they do not divide the Law into five Volums: but comprehend it in one Volum, according to that ancient Cuſtom, which was obſerv'd even in Chriſts time. By and by proceeding a little farther, the Learned Gentleman affirms that in the time of <hi>Aquila,</hi> whom he calls a moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Interpreter, the <hi>Jews</hi> or elſe <hi>Aquila</hi> himſelf invented a moſt wicked and idle diviſion of the Sacred Books, in hatred to

                     <hi>Daniel's weeks,</hi> and that they perverted the ſenſe and order of Scripture by introducing a New Diſtribution, that is to ſay, of the Law, the Prophets, and the <hi>Hagiographers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whether a new diſtribution of the Books, ſo the Books be entire, let the perſpicacious judge. But leaſt I may ſeem to carp at ſmall things, I ſay it is much more probable that <hi>Aquila</hi> in his Tranſlation of the ſacred Writings obſerv'd that order which according to the method of that Age, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies ſet before him, when there appear'd no reaſon for the Charge.</p>
                  <p>But he did that, ſays <hi>Voſſius,</hi> in hatred of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s weeks, whom he caſt into the laſt place, almoſt among the <hi>Hagiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;</hi> as if the <hi>Jews</hi> did not give the ſame Credit to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as the Chriſtians. <hi>Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> admires at their ſimplicity who believe the <hi>Rabbins</hi> aſſerting the <hi>Ketuvim,</hi> or Books of the <hi>Hagiographers</hi> to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>If you conſult the Rabbins,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they will l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Let there be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> (ſays Capellus) <hi>to every one of thoſe ancient Verſions their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Praiſe and Honour, by reaſon of their Antiquity, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe in the Church; nevertheleſs, where they are manifeſtly viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, defective, and mutilated, let not their imperfection be preferred before the Original Truth, and Authentick Text: nor through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perverſe, wicked, wrangling and contentious envy, or rather dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ill cuſtome, be advanced before the much better and more acurate Tranſlations.</hi> Therefore in the Opinion of <hi>Capellus,</hi> there might be a better and more acurate Tranſlation of the <hi>Sacred Text,</hi> then that of the <hi>Seventy.</hi> To theſe many other things of the ſame Nature might be added, which I omit, for fear of being troubleſome.

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſtands very furiouſly upon it, That all the <hi>Jews</hi> who preceded the time wherein Chriſt was upon the Earth, acknowledged this Verſion only as lawful: That till the time of <hi>Aquila,</hi> no other was read in all the <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Verſion of the <hi>Seventy Interpreters,</hi> not only in <hi>Aegypt, Aſia,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Syria,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Judea,</hi> where from the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, no other Language was heard to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50875:128"/>be ſpoken but the <hi>Greek,</hi> eſpecially in Cities and great Towns; nay that in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf no other then the <hi>Greek</hi> Language was ſpoken; and that if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Scripture were read firſt, the <hi>Greek</hi> Explanation followed. But ſo many words as <hi>Voſſius</hi> has publiſhed, ſo many fictions hath he ſpread abroad. For firſt it is manifeſt, that before the <hi>Verſion</hi> of the <hi>Seventy</hi> Interpreters from the time of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> there was no other Scripture read in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues then the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context. For the <hi>Jews</hi> had not ſo far forgot their Language in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, but that it remain'd among the Prophets, Prieſts and Perſons of Principal Note; as <hi>Joſephus Albo,</hi> a moſt eminent <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Divine informs us; and that not unwillingly <hi>Voſſius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, who believes that the <hi>Seventy</hi> interpreted the Bible, at what time the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language was in a flouriſhing Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and familiarly ſpoken. Then again that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text was read at leaſt in ſome Synagogues after the Tranſlation of the <hi>Seventy Interpreters,</hi> neither can the Learned Perſon deny, who writes that <hi>Flavius Joſephus</hi> Interpreted the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, and ſet forth his Hiſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Wars in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> before he wrote it in <hi>Greek.</hi> With which Argument <hi>Voſſius</hi> had refuted thoſe who objected againſt him that he knew not his own Language, nor ever ſaw an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exemplar, againſt whom he oppoſes the words of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who writes of himſelf that he excell'd the reſt of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the Learning of his Country; but that he had only learnt the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue Grammatically, and wanted an acurate Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Voſſius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who ſpeaks contradictions, not only the common People who liv'd in the Country and in Villages, made uſe of the <hi>Syriac</hi> Dialect; but the Principal perſons, among whom was <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who calls the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriac</hi> his Native Language, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of which being a little harſh and rugged, was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he could hardly pronounce the <hi>Greek,</hi> which was much more ſmooth and Polite. Now then if the <hi>Greek</hi> Language were ſo naturally ſpoken in Citys and <hi>Greek</hi> Towns, why did <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who was not bred up in the Country Villages, learn the <hi>Greek</hi> Grammatically. I forbear to prove that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpake <hi>Syriac</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as is manifeſt out of the Books of the New Teſtament. Therefore it is a meer Fiction which <hi>Voſſius</hi> aſſerts concerning the <hi>Hieroſolymitan</hi> Synagogues,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50875:128"/>that there was no other Language us'd therein then the, <hi>Greek. For,</hi> ſaith the Learned Gentleman, <hi>if the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Text were read firſt, the</hi> Greek <hi>Interpretation followed, becauſe the ancient</hi> Hebrew <hi>was only underſtood by the Learned.</hi> Certainly <hi>Voſſius</hi> is a moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Argumentator, who from thence, that the Learned only underſtood the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language concludes that the <hi>Greek</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation followed. He had ſpoken much more truly, had he ſaid in thoſe places where the <hi>Syriac</hi> Language was natural to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, that the <hi>Syriac</hi> Interpretation followed the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; but where the <hi>Greek</hi> was more familiar, <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came after. Thus alſo at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Synagogue of the <hi>Alexandrinians</hi> who ſpake <hi>Greek,</hi> I make no queſtion but the Sacred Text was read firſt in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> according to the ancient Cuſtom of the Synagogue, then in <hi>Greek</hi> by ſome Interpreter, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient uſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſince their return from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, after the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language ceas'd to be familiar, had Interpreters appointed to turn the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words into the Vulgar Language, that they might be underſtood by all the common People. In which ſence I ſhould think the words of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> are to be expounded, by which the Learned prove that in the ancient times, the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the <hi>Seventy</hi> was publickly read in the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call'd <hi>Helleniſts.</hi> For if the words of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> are but attentively conſidered, it will be apparent, that in thoſe Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation was only made uſe of to aſſiſt the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Context by way of Interpretation, as at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and other more neighbouring places, the <hi>Chaldee-Syriac</hi> was joyn'd with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lectures for the ſame purpoſe. Nevertheleſs I willingly acknowledge with <hi>Voſſius</hi> that the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue had in ſome meaſure got a great footing in <hi>Judea,</hi> eſpecially among the Perſons of chief Quality and Magiſtrates; yet ſo that the <hi>Chaldee-Syriac</hi> which their Anceſtors brought from <hi>Babylon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd. And to believe this, I am not only induced by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> but by many teſtimonies of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from whence it is plain that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpake <hi>Syriac.</hi> But we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of theſe things hereafter again. There are ſome other Objections which <hi>Voſſius</hi> has heap'd together in his little Treatiſe concerning the Oracles of the <hi>Sibylls;</hi> but becauſe the Learned Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats them again in his anſwer to the late <hi>Critica Sacra,</hi> it will
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50875:129"/>be ſufficient to examin them being collected altogether. Let us ſee therefore whether he be more ſucceſsful in that part.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Front <hi>Voſſius</hi> praiſes the Author of the <hi>Critica Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra,</hi> which he attributes to <hi>Simon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Veſſ.</hi> in Reſp. ad Object. Nuper Crit.</note> becauſe the ancient Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that is, the <hi>Seventy,</hi> and the Obſervations of <hi>Capellus</hi> pleaſe him. He alſo extols and admires <hi>Simon</hi>'s diligence or rather patience, in turning over ſo many Writings of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> But becauſe he believes there may be ſomething of ſolidity in their Expoſitions and Traditions, propagated only by the Ear, and ſo much that ſometimes he ſcruples not to prefer them before the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the 70, therein <hi>Voſſius</hi> openly profeſſes that he cannot agree with him: Nor does he believe that any ingenious perſon will conſent to <hi>Simon</hi> in that particular. Certainly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus,</hi> whom <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſo much admires may be liſted for an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentleman, and that deſervedly too. And in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, <hi>Simon</hi> has not ſwerv'd from <hi>Capellus,</hi> the leaſt Tittle, who ſharply girds <hi>Morinus</hi> and his Ape <hi>Voſſius</hi> as immoderate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who out of a perverſe and damnable ill cuſtome, prefer the ancient Tranſlations to others far more acurate. In this moreover <hi>Simon</hi> diſpleaſes <hi>Voſſius,</hi> for writing that ſometimes St. <hi>Jerom</hi> receded judiciouſly from the ancient Interpreters, as if thoſe ancient ones had been free from all Miſtake and Error. Nor does <hi>Capellus</hi> forſake <hi>Simon</hi> in this particular. For where <hi>Capellus</hi> in the place above cited has obſerv'd ſeveral Childiſh Miſtakes frequently taken notice of in the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the <hi>Seventy</hi> Interpreters, he compares this and that of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and prefers that of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> as that which produces bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſence:<note place="margin">In Apol. adv. Boot.</note> and laſtly he adds theſe words. <hi>Six hundred, yea innumerable, are the places that might be produced, in which from the ſame Copy with that in uſe at this day, St.</hi> Jerom <hi>has expreſſed the ſence of Sacred Scripture much otherwiſe, and much more happily then the</hi> Seventy <hi>Interpreters, as being aſſiſted by their Labours and Tranſlation, as alſo with the Verſions of others, as</hi> Aquila, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus, Theodotian, <hi>by which means he was able to diſcern the failings and Errors of thoſe men.</hi> Nor indeed do any who have any thing of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Learning think otherwiſe of <hi>Jerom,</hi> unleſs it be ſingle Dr. <hi>Voſſius,</hi> who in imitation of <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> believes that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> undertook a new Verſion of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Text, with a reſolution altogether <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and pre-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd by the <hi>Rabbies.</hi> For that ſame Prophetick Spirit attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50875:129"/>to the <hi>Greek Interpreters,</hi> which our Anceſtors ſo much ador'd, is long ſince vaniſh'd by the Authority of St. <hi>Jerow</hi> himſelf. But let us return to the buſineſs in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Voſſius</hi> furiouſly maintains that there is nothing of ſolidity in the Expoſitions of the late <hi>Rabbys</hi> and their Traditions, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated only by the Ear, chiefly induc'd by this Argument; for that Traditions which are propagated by the Ear, rarely laſt above two or three Ages. If it be ſo, how came it to paſs, that the <hi>Seventy Interpreters</hi> after the <hi>Hebrew Language</hi> being loſt for two Ages, could make ſuch a Verſion of the <hi>Hebrew Codex,</hi> in all things ſo abſolute, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> feigns it? Queſtionleſs, ſome will ſay he avers nothing wonderful as to this particular, while he believes them to be Prophets. But whom ſhall we believe, <hi>Voſſius</hi> affirming the <hi>Greek Interpreters</hi> to have been Prophets, or <hi>Jerome</hi> denying it? But you will object, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> was half a <hi>Rabby,</hi> who durſt preſume to make a new Tranſlation contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the general conſent of the Church: and that <hi>Voſſius</hi> is a <hi>Sybilliſt,</hi> who has rais'd up new Prophets and Sooth-ſayers, till now unknown, nor ever heard of. That ſame <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Rabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Verſion</hi> of <hi>Jerome</hi> has had many Applauders, Conſpicuous for their Piety and Learning. But there is not one in our Age who embraces <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s Judgment for receiving the only Verſion of the Seventy, excepting ſome Diſciples of <hi>Socinus,</hi> who greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowed his Opinion. It will not be amiſs to inſpect the Matter a little more narrowly, and to manifeſt the Nature of Tradition upon which the reading of the <hi>Hebrew Context</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
                  <p>I grant that matters of Religion, chiefly which belong to Doctrine more remote from the Sences, cannot be preſerved for many Ages by the help of Tradition, without the aſſiſtance of writing. But as to matter of Diſcipline and Ceremonies, there is a quite contrary Judgment to be made, for that thoſe things happen to be in uſe every day; And for this ſort of Tradition, and Ancient Fathers of the Church give their ſuffrages. Now, I ſay there is the ſame Qualification of Languages, which though they become obſolete and ceaſe to be Natural, yet among the Doctors in the School, preſerve their ancient Vigour and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and to this ſort of Tradition we refer the Tradition of the <hi>Hebrew Language</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Hence without doubt it came to paſs, that in theſe modern times the <hi>Samaritans</hi> have
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50875:130"/>the ſame Books of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> have, ſome ſmall matter excepted. And from that Tradition it comes to paſs, that not only the Eaſtern and Weſtern <hi>Jews</hi> conſent among themſelves about the reading of the <hi>Hebrew Context,</hi> but alſo they who bear the Name of <hi>Carraim</hi> among them: becauſe that rejecting the <hi>Talmud</hi> and other uncertain Traditions, they adhere to the Scripture, and agree with the <hi>Jews</hi> in all things, as to the Truth of reading the Sacred Context. And therefore that Tradition is not raſhly to be exploded with the <hi>Carraeans,</hi> who reject moſt of the <hi>Jewiſh Traditions,</hi> entirely embrac'd. Here I could heap together many other things taken out of the <hi>Jewiſh Books,</hi> by which they prove, that their Anceſtors ever ſince the times of <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> had Schools as well among the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> as among the <hi>Hieroſolymitans.</hi> But I forbear to inſiſt upon theſe things, and many other of the ſame Nature, becauſe they do not pleaſe the Palate of the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Voſſius,</hi> who does not by any means reliſh <hi>Rabbiniſm.</hi> I am not ignorant that many <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially they who are of the <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians</hi> Form, who believe that not only the Sacred Books were variouſly diſperſed, and miſerably mutilated, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> and <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fodaeus</hi> were of Opinion, but that the Language was almoſt loſt: and with theſe thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who are of the Sect of the <hi>Carraeans</hi> agree.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aaron Ben Joſeph,</hi> praef. com. in pent.</note> For thus writes <hi>Aaron Ben Joſeph</hi> upon this Argument. <hi>The Iſraelites were exiles out of their own in a forreign Land, and Viſion and Propheſie were ſealed up, and there wanted but little, but that the Hebrew Language had been quite loſt. Then certain wiſe Iſraclites roſe up,</hi>

Nor do I believe that the <hi>Greek Verſion</hi> of the Seventy, of which afterwards the <hi>Jews</hi> feign'd ſuch miraculous Stories, had any other Original; whoſe Idle Dreams <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſo greedily followed, as if thoſe <hi>Jews</hi>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:50875:130"/>were only to be believ'd by the Chriſtians. Then again in the Synagogue and Schools belonging to ſuch places, where the Greek Tongue was natural, there the Greek Tranſlation of the <hi>Alexandrinian Jews</hi> was read, which whithin a ſhort ſpace of time reach'd the reſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> who ſpake the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, as being the Language of thoſe that were in power. However, the reading of the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> was not left off, in whoſe aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the <hi>Greek Tranſlation</hi> was only made uſe of. Neither will <hi>Voſſius</hi> deny that, who aſſerts, that both <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> who was an <hi>Alexandrinian,</hi> were learned in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> When then was the <hi>Hebrew Language</hi> loſt? was it in the time of <hi>Aquila,</hi> whom <hi>Voſſius</hi> calls a moſt impertinent Interpreter?

                     </gap>ws, to which at length the Family of the <hi>Criticks</hi> call'd <hi>Mazeries</hi> was well known: And they were call'd <hi>Mazorites,</hi> becauſe they bounded and regulated the <hi>Mazora,</hi> or Tradition of reading the <hi>Hebrew Context</hi> then receiv'd by all the <hi>Jews</hi> by the help of certain Marks or Tittles, which ſerv'd inſtead of Vowels. This is the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition to which <hi>Simon</hi> attributes moſt credit; but upon which he does not wholly depend, while he does not put a ſmall value upon the Tradition, or reading of the <hi>Hebrew Context</hi> which the <hi>Greek Interpreters</hi> follow'd. Nay, ſometimes he does not ſcruple to prefer it before the <hi>Maſoretic,</hi> becauſe he did not ſet himſelf to write with a mind pre-engag'd by the <hi>Greek Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> as <hi>Voſſius;</hi> nor by the <hi>Latin,</hi> as moſt of the Divines of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> nor by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the Croud of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, ſays the moſt learned <hi>Voſſius,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> are Enemies to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and therefore the reading of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought not to be fetch'd from them: as if any Art could be better learnt from any other then they who profeſs it. But then <hi>Voſſius</hi> urges again, and Confeſſes that the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to be fetch'd from the <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, but from thoſe ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> who preceded the time of Chriſt, not from the latter <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who underſtood it not at all. And in this alſo <hi>Simon</hi> agrees with <hi>Voſſius,</hi> that the Tradition of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> reading is to be taken from thoſe ancient <hi>Jews;</hi> only in this he differs from him, in ſaving not only from thoſe, but from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50875:131"/>Symmachus, Theodotion, Jerome,</hi> and all other Interpreters of the Sacred Scripture; for that no Art can be brought to perfection by one or another, but by many together. <hi>Simon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf under the Laws of no Maſter: he denyes that a perfect knowledg of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue can be attain'd by the vulgar Rules of the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> as being confin'd within too narrow limits. Furthermore, he believes it neceſſary to have recourſe to the ancient Interpreters in imitation of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who not only Conſulted the <hi>Rabbys</hi> of his own Age, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Seventy Interpreters, ſometimes <hi>Aquila,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Theodotion,</hi> or any other, whoſe Interpretation ſeem'd moſt to the Purpoſe. And we have no reaſon in our Age, of making another Tranſlation of the Bible, which may excel all the reſt: For it is not true, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> often inculcates, that only one St. <hi>Jerome</hi> durſt preſume to vary from the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> For you ſhall find the reſt of the Fathers have frequent recourſe to the Verſions of <hi>Aquila, Symmachus,</hi> or <hi>Theodotion,</hi> becauſe their ſenſe ſometimes appears to be better. To ſay Truth, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more from <hi>Voſſius,</hi> who believes, that the Seventy Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being taken away, all the remaining knowledge of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language</hi> is utterly loſt, and that without them no one word can rightly be expounded. That <hi>Aquila</hi> and other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, fail'd wherever they departed from the Ancient Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that he was an Idle Interpreter, who being learned in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> did not give the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words new ſignifications from the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> but only retain'd thoſe ſignifications us'd by the <hi>Greek Interpreters,</hi> though in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Order, and accommodating other Notions to other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And yet <hi>Origen</hi> frequently commends that ſame <hi>Aquila,</hi> whoſe Verſion <hi>Voſſius</hi> affirms to be ſo full of trivial words: ſpeaking of <hi>Aquila,</hi> as of a perſon, who ſearching out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of words, and dilligently adhering to their ſignifications, ſtudyed to give them the moſt proper Interpretation; <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Aquila</hi> labouring to Interpret by words that carryed moſt Authority. But if <hi>Aquila</hi> apply'd the ſame Notions of the <hi>Hebrew Language</hi> variouſly in ſeveral and different places, thoſe places are to be weigh'd, and Judgment is to be given, whether he have ſwery'd truly or falſly from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters. Certain it is, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſometimes preferr'd <hi>Aquila</hi> before the <hi>Seventy Interpreters,</hi> becauſe they ſeem'd to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50875:131"/>favour the <hi>Jews.</hi> In like manner <hi>Origen</hi> thought that <hi>Aquila</hi> had in ſeveral places more properly expreſs'd the words of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Context then the 70.</p>
                  <p>There it is a fiction of <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s, that there was no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the ancient Chriſtians, upon whom a clearer light of <hi>Hebrew</hi> truth ſhone, then upon all the Chriſtian <hi>Rabbies</hi> and <hi>Semi-Rabbies</hi> of our Age. For as it was moſt excellently obſerv'd by <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> there is nothing that was ever begun and perfected both at one time. The Tranſlation of the 70 Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters was corrected by <hi>Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> and as St. <hi>Jerow's,</hi> ſo is that mended every day by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons learned in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Languages. In this alone the <hi>Septuagint</hi> excells all the other Verſions of Sacred Scripture, for that it was the firſt of all the Tranſlations, from which all the ſucceeding Interpreters drew many things proper for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Nor do I queſtion but that in the time of <hi>Philo,</hi> there were extant <hi>Lexicons</hi> of <hi>Hebrew</hi> words taken out of the Verſion of the 70, both at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and other places. Nor will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that <hi>Aquila</hi> might make uſe of them as great helps in compiling his Tranſlation. But for me to believe that he who in the Opinions of <hi>Origen, Jerom</hi> and other Fathers, did not conſult the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time, is a thing almoſt impoſſible; and why <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſhould think ſo there ſeems to be no other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then a pre-engag'd Opinion that the 70 Interpreters are the only perſons, with whom the knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was buried. And indeed whatever <hi>Voſſius</hi> throws upon <hi>Aquila,</hi> may be ſaid of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> though it be moſt certain that he conſulted the Jewiſh Doctors of his time, when he was compiling his Tranſlation; and very often rather choſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, then upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpretation. For he often declares in his works that he was inſtructed by the moſt learned Doctors of his Age. The ſame is <hi>Aquila</hi>'s caſe, whom he calls ſometimes contentious Interpreter, becauſe he ſticks ſometimes too cloſe to the ſignification of the words, more eager upon the force of the word then the Sence of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For which reaſon <hi>Jerom</hi> accuſes him of deprav'd affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, but never of Ignorance; which affectation <hi>Origen</hi> aſcribes to his too much dilligence.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Voſſius</hi> paſſes to other matters. He denies that the Sence of Scripture can be plough'd forth of a Mute <hi>Codex,</hi> which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50875:132"/>heither any man knows how to read or underſtand, as being half maim'd, and furniſh'd with no other Vowels then what the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Chriſtian Faith have fix'd to it. And thus he thought it not enough to traduce the Interpreters of Holy Writ, unleſs he accuſe the Books themſelves. Every Foot and even to loathing he objects in his little Treatiſe, that the Hebrew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex is mute; as if it had been leſs mute in the Age of the 70 Interpreters then in our time. This is the manner of Writing among the <hi>Orientals,</hi> to follow Compendium's: Nor is the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language more ſubject to this vice, than the <hi>Arabic, Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Syriac,</hi> whoſe manner of writing is Compendious likewiſe. The Condition of the Exemplars which the 70 Interpreters made uſe of was no better. But there was a certain manner of writing confirm'd by Uſe and Cuſtom amongſt the Hebrews and the reſt of the <hi>Orientals,</hi> eſpecially the Rabbies as now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. For after the Invention of points moſt of the Oriental Bocks were ſet forth without 'em; nevertheleſs they who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their Languages read with no leſs accurateneſs, then if the points were added. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> never burden'd their Exemplars with points, nor are they to be ſeen in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars of the <hi>Jews</hi> or Volums that are publickly uſed in the Synagogues. Are therefore thoſe Exemplars mute? The <hi>Jews</hi> have alſo their Vowels that no way depend upon thoſe points, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> himſelf confeſſes; but the Trrnſcribers ſometime add, ſometimes omit them at their own pleaſure. Wherefore the prudent <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> moſt excellently obſerves, that as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular the <hi>Mazorites</hi> laboured to little purpoſe, who over-care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully markt how many times a word is written full, how many times defective, that is when it is repreſented with its Vowels. <hi>The Tranſcriber,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Praef. inpent.</note> ſaies <hi>Eben Ezra ſometimes in writing expreſſes the word full ſometimes defective, and that for Brevities ſake.</hi> If any one would take the pains to compare as well the ancient as later Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together, he ſhall diſcern that from that ſame preſence or abſence of the Vowels, ſomething of difference has happen'd in Tranſlating the Context. Nor do the Jewiſh Rabbies agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves in this particular, as <hi>F. Simon</hi> makes apparent in ſeveral Examples, who therefore does no way detract from the Jewiſh Exemplars; but lays that fault, if ſuch a one it be, upon the Nature of the Oriental Languages. By this means,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50875:132"/>the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Doctors, adding Points of the ſame Nature, have ſettled the reading of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to prevent it's being torn into ſeveral Parts at Liberty of every one. And certainly the Induſtry of the Jews is to be commended in this particular, who by the benefit of Points have conſulted the Exactneſs of reading the Sacred Writings for the good of Poſterity. Certain it is, that in every Age there was ſome <hi>Maſora</hi> or other, at leaſt among the Doctors of the Hebrew Language worthy to be ſeen; becauſe it was always a certain guide for the reading of the Hebrew Context. Though it varyed ſometimes, according to the Diverſity of Ages, as may be diſcerned by the comparing Variety of Tranſlations. Wherefore <hi>Voſſius</hi> does not ſeem to have underſtood this whole Matter, who writes that for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Vowels, the miſerable Jews were reduced to that pitch of Ignorance, that they knew not how to read, unleſs to the Hebrew words were added the ſame words expreſſed in Greek Letters, which ſupplyed the defect of the Vowels. <hi>This manner of writing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>received by the Jews, Origen followed, oppoſing againſt the Hebrew and Samaritan, the ſame Hebrew and Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Words, expreſſed in Greek Letters, the Vowels being only added that they might be conveniently read.</hi> Truly both in this Place, as in many others, the moſt Learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> has deviſed wonders. For not to inſiſt that it is a meer Fiction which he urges concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hebrew Context inſerted in <hi>Samaritan</hi> Letters in <hi>Origen</hi>'s <hi>Hexaples,</hi> no man in his wit will believe that <hi>Origen</hi> borrowed from the Jews the manner of writing the Hebrew Text in Greek Letters; but rather that he, for the benefit of his own Countrymen, wrote the Hebrew words firſt in the Hebrew Letters, and then in Greek Characters; to the end that they who underſtood nothing of the Hebrew, might read the Hebrew. For to ſay Truth, the Jews at that time, as they do at this day, eaſily read their own Context without Points; and beſides this, without any other aſſiſtance but of the Hebrew Letters, they not only read the Books of the Rabbies, but any other Books upon various Diſcourſes. Thus they have the Greek and Spaniſh Verſions of the Bibles written not in Greek and Spaniſh, but in Hebrew Characters; of which I will here ſet down ſome few Examples, that the more skilful may judge, whether the Jews were ſo miſerable that they could not write the words of their own Language, but in Foraign Characters; while they write, and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50875:133"/>that properly enough the Languages of other Nations in Jewiſh Letters. Thus in the Greek Interpretation of the Pentateuch ſet forth at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> we read in Hebrew Letters <gap reason="foreign">

Nor is that Example any more to the purpoſe, which <hi>Voſſius</hi> annexes from the written Works of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> had they come to our Hands without Vowels, in regard there is a vaſt difference between the <hi>Greek, Latin</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> Languages. The Learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man adds another Fiction, that this manner of Writing that is in Greek Letters, was in uſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> for almoſt a Thouſand Years, that is to ſay to the time of the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> who almoſt ſix Hundred Years before, neglecting this double manner of Writing, imitating the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd Points and Tittles, which they made uſe of inſtead of Vowels. But as to that, 'tis now eight Hundred Years ago, that <hi>R. Saadias</hi> wrote certain little Treatiſes of Grammer, whence it appears, that before thoſe times Point-Vowels were added to the Exemplars of the Bible. To what end does he mention the <hi>Mazorites,</hi> whom I do not deny to have been the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of points, when they themſelves liv'd long before <hi>R Saa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias?</hi> But, ſaies <hi>Voſſius,</hi> that points are a late Invention is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from hence, for that there appears no Book, no Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that is more ancient than five Hundred Years. By the ſame reaſon I might ſay, that before ſix Hundred Years ago, there were no Hebrew Exemplars of the Bible, which are not to be found in our age, which pretend to a higher Antiquity. But I bluſh to ſpend more time in refuting theſe things which are ſo openly falſe. <hi>F. Simon.</hi> has produc'd Monuments much more Ancient, wherein the Points are to be ſeen. After this <hi>Voſſius</hi> violently Aſſails the Jews, and infers that they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted wrong and depraved Vowels to moſt words from the proper Names which we frequently meet with in the Goſpels and other Writings of the Antient <hi>Jews. That of neceſſity,</hi> ſaith the Learned Gentleman, <hi>the modern points were added ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and injudiciouſly, or that Chriſt and all the Apoſtles and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Jews were ignorant of the Names of the Prophets and their Fore-Fathers.</hi> But the moſt excellent <hi>Voſſius</hi> does not obſerve that thoſe very Names are pronounc'd and written at this very day by the Jews of various Nations, after a different manu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:50875:134"/>another way. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> come neareſt the Ancient manner of Writing and Pronouncing, becauſe their pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is more pure. But the <hi>German Jews</hi> are farther off then all the reſt, from the true manner of Writing and Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, which is manifeſt from the Books which they have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally written in the <hi>Itaiian, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Languages, wherein the Hebrew words are written after a quite different manner, and in other Letters. But it is certain that they did not derive that variety of Writing from the various Lections of the Hebrew Exemplars. But the fault of Pronunciation which ariſes from the vulgar Speech, draws along with it the errours of Spelling and Writing. Whence it comes to paſs, that moſt of the <hi>Hebrecians</hi> who learn Hebrew from <hi>Buxtorf's</hi> Hebrew Grammar, pronounce the Hebrew words very ill, and after the <hi>German</hi> manner.

                  <p>But now the Learned Gentleman contends that the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hebrew words becomes uncertain, by reaſon of the defect of the Vowels, and believes <hi>F.

                     </gap> to <hi>interpret:</hi> As if the preſent Diſpute were concerning this Sort of Propheſie. <hi>Voſſius</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided by <hi>Simon</hi> for endeavouring to ſet a foot again his ſtale and rank Opinion of the Prophetſhip of the LXX. Interpreters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereto by no other Arguments, than out of a hatred to thoſe whom they call <hi>Semi-Rabbies:</hi> But whether thoſe things tend, which the moſt acute Gentleman more prolixly faigns, to ſhew that not only among the <hi>Greeks</hi> but alſo among the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> the Interpreters and Fore-tellers of Dreams and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things were called Prophets, I am not ſo <hi>Argus</hi> Ey'd as to perceive. He alſo vehemently maintains that God conferr'd the gift of Propheſie upon the Worſhippers of Idols. But what is all this to the preſent purpoſe? He calls the Greek Verſion divinely inſpired, and labours very hard to prove that the Authors thereof were inſpir'd with the Holy Ghoſt, and to make their <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50875:135"/>forge new in this place, to refute them afterwards with his own Fictitious Reaſon. <hi>Simon</hi> thought the opinion of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, who wrote that it was not likely, that <hi>Stephen</hi> in his Sermon to the <hi>Hieroſolymitan</hi> Jews, quoted his Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Teſtamonies out of any other then the Hebrew Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars. <hi>Simon</hi> does not ſpeak of words of the Sermon which it is plain were ſpoken in the <hi>Syriac,</hi> but of the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which are cited by <hi>Stephen</hi> in that Sermon. <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s device is, as if <hi>Simon</hi> thought that the common People in the time of the Apoſtles underſtood the Ancient Hebrew Language, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he rather every where affirms, that the vulgar of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſpoke <hi>Syriac.</hi> In the <hi>Hieraſolymitan</hi> Synagogues, where the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riac</hi> was altogether natural, the Law was not read in Greek but Hebrew, to which the <hi>Syriac</hi> and not the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpretation was joyn'd, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> has faign'd.</p>
                  <p>Again he maliciouſly objects againſt <hi>Simon,</hi> that the Writing of <hi>Aristaeus</hi> was by him treaſur'd up among the Fictitious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for that reaſon, becauſe it was a ſolemn cuſtom of the Jews to faign and write things Incredible; when as thoſe things which are contain'd in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, are more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; as if <hi>Simon</hi> had only prov'd from the ſolemn Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> to feign and write Incredibilities, that the Hiſtory of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaeus</hi> was Fictitious. Whereas he produces moſt ſolid Reaſons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the work of <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> himſelf, and ſhews upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Phylo Herennius,</hi> which <hi>Origen</hi> Reports, that the Jews of that time feign'd many things very improbable. But I do not wonder that <hi>Voſſius</hi> compares ſuch ſort of Impoſtors with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, who had already ſeated them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Prophets. Nevertheleſs in the ſame Treatiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as for the moſt part always he ſpeaks thoſe things that hardly hold Water, the learned Gentleman Writes, that Truth is a Stranger to the Writings of the Jews, that there is ſo much Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſo much Barbarity, ſuch a World of Fictions, that there is nothing more true then that Satyrical Sarcaſm.</p>

                  <p>Maliciouſly alſo, and quite contrary to the meaning of <hi>Simon, Voſſius</hi> adds ſome other things, to which it is needleſs to anſwer,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50875:136"/>ſeeing that <hi>Simon</hi>'s Book it ſelf is now every where publick both in Latin and French, tho the new French Edition, and the Latin which is taken out of it, is very full of faults of the Preſs. But now <hi>Voſſius</hi> to preſs <hi>Simon</hi> the more home, demands from whence <hi>Demetrius Falarius</hi> had his ſtory of the Kings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> if in his time there were no Greek Verſion. This alſo <hi>Voſſius</hi> feigns to fancy himſelf an Adverſary, For <hi>Simon</hi> will readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Hiſtory of <hi>Demetrius</hi> was taken out of the Greek Verſion, which is vulgarly attributed to the 70 Elders: Nor does he ever diſpute of the Age wherein the Authors of that Verſion liv'd, but of the Authors themſelves, and believes that what is reported by <hi>Ariſteus</hi> concerning them, to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As to the time wherein that Verſion was began and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Voſſius</hi> will not find <hi>F.

In the mean time let the moſt delicate <hi>Voſſius</hi> enjoy his own judgment, who ſo greedily catches at dreams more than Rabbinically, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Learned Gentleman, now grown more perſpicacious, has enter'd the Lifts, he now no longer doubts, that not only the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> but all the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Books</hi> were Tranſlated by the 70 Interpreters, though he confeſſes he doubted it before. Nevertheleſs, the reaſons of his doubting are very ponderous, which are to be fetch'd from the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Joſephus, Jerom</hi> and the Ancient Jews, F. <hi>Simon</hi> had denied that the words of <hi>Ariſteus</hi> were underſtood by <hi>Voſſius;</hi> now the Learned Gentleman appeals to all that underſtand Greek, to whoſe determination I think we ought to ſtand; and I could wiſh that the ſame Judges were to conſider what <hi>Voſſius</hi> has transferred out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and other Writers, into his is that incomparable Gentleman in all things, who again deviſes new <hi>Hexaples</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> which were never yet ſeen.

Yet we may ſuſpect with <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that <hi>Origen</hi> did not ſo entirely correct the Greek Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, which he himſelf acknowledges to have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Errours and Faults, but that he alter'd ſome places under pretence of Amendment, when as he did not only exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But theſe things which ſeem to be more nice, and not ſo fit for vulgar Ears. Therefore the Learned Gentleman is in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who believ'd that <hi>Origen</hi> approv'd no other Exemplars but thoſe of the Septuagint. He is ignorant of the Laws of that management which moſt of the Fathers, eſpecially <hi>Origen,</hi> obſerv'd, to the end they might accommodate themſelves to the already received opinions of the People; which prudence of <hi>Origen</hi> in our Age, the moſt Eminent Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do imitate, who granting to the People the uſe of the Latin Edition, reſerve to themſelves the knowledge of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Truth. Now becauſe <hi>Simon</hi> gives no credit to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious diſcourſes of <hi>Ariſtaeus,</hi> concerning the 70 Interpreters, while he endeavours to give a reaſon why it was fixed upon the 70, he confeſſes that he adheres to the opinion of thoſe, who believe it to have born that name from the 72 Senators of the <hi>Hieroſolymitan Sanhedrim,</hi> who approv'd it by their Sufferage and Authority. Yet he affirms nothing, but only makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture upon a thing ſo obſcure and ſo far remote from our times. But notwithſtanding all his Modeſty <hi>Voſſius</hi> falls fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, and demands if that Greek Verſion were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the whole <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> how it came to be ſo full of faults,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50875:137"/>as if of neceſſity the Authority of the Grave <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> which <hi>Simon</hi> ſuſpects to have allow'd that Verſion to be publickly read in the Synagogues and Schools, had been ſufficient to exempt it from all Errour? Certainly it could derive no greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Decree of the <hi>Hieroſolymitan</hi> Senators, then was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to the Latin Edition, after the Fathers of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> had authoriz'd it by their Conſtitution. Was the Latin Interpreter therefore purg'd from all the faults with which it formerly abounded? No. In this alſo appears the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality between both decrees, that as it came to paſs in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Church, through Ignorance of the Greek and Hebrew Languages, that the Bibles were Tranſlated and read in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tongue, ſo alſo the Ignorance of the Hebrew among the <hi>Helleniſt Jews,</hi> was the reaſon that the <hi>Alexandrian Jews</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated for their own uſe the Sacred Writing into Greek, which Greek Tranſlation afterwards grew to be currant among all the Jews that underſtood Greek, and was perhaps approv'd by the <hi>Hieroſolymitan</hi> Senators. I ſay perhaps, becauſe there is no need to have recourſe to their Authority, for the Expoſition of the reaſon why this Verſion was attributed to the 70 Elders.</p>
                  <p>But only we are to obſerve the form of Speech ſo familiar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, whereby the uſ'd to refer all things which ſeemed to be of any moment <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>To the Men of the great Synagogue.</hi> Which kind of Phraſe has lead many Learned Men into ſeveral Errors while they turn over the Books of the <hi>Jews</hi> with a Circumſpection too remiſs; whereas we are to heed not ſo much what thoſe Doctors ſay, as how and for what reaſon they ſpeak it. So the <hi>Rabbies</hi> eagerly maintain, that the Points of the Holy Scripture and ſuch other things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Original from the Men of the Great Synagogue, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the Phraſe of the Country, not according to the Truth of the Thing. And thus it is more proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion was attributed to the <hi>Seventy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,</hi> than with <hi>Voſſius</hi> to give credit to the Fictions of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtaeus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then again the Learned Gentleman is diſpleas'd that <hi>Simon</hi> endeavour'd to reſtore the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language exploded by the Learned men, and to obtrude it under the name of the Language moſt currant in the Synagogue; as if among them there had been any more peculiar Language, which was neither
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50875:137"/>
                     <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that by that means he might make it out that the <hi>Seventy</hi> Interpreters underſtood neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</hi> Certainly <hi>Simon</hi> knew what had been already written by the Defenders of the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language, but with the good favour of that Learned Gentleman. I may ſay, that while he diſputed about the ſhadow of an Aſs, he did but raiſe Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about a Name, <hi>Simon</hi> does not lay ignorance to the charge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> but only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or a deprav'd affectation natural to the <hi>Jews</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Tranſlating the Scriptures, who while they labour to expreſs the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words too curiouſly and literally, turn a little aſide from the common and more receiv'd Idiome and to ſome words give particular and diſtinct Notions from the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. This is to be obſerv'd almoſt in all the Verſions of Sacred Scripture compil'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Simon</hi> truly demonſtrates: by whom it was alſo moſt excellently obſerv'd, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpretation of the <hi>Seventy</hi> Seniors was hardly underſtood by moſt of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, becauſe it retain'd ſomething of the Idiom of the <hi>Syriac</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language. And thus the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tranſlation ſet forth at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which was done by the <hi>Jews,</hi> can hardly be read by thoſe who underſtand not <hi>Hebrew,</hi> though well vers'd in the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> And this was the reaſon why the ancient Interpreter of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion has but ill rendred not a few <hi>Greek</hi> words, not having attain'd the force and propriety of their ſignification.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50875:139"/>ſquare Trees or Timber, which are moſt fit for the building a Ship, as being that which not only affords the Materials of Building, but alſo <hi>Pitch</hi> to Pitch the Veſſel. I will not deny but that <hi>Cedar, Firr</hi> and <hi>Pines</hi> which are <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s four ſquare Trees may be very proper to Build a Ship, but why he ſhould deny that Plank or flat Boards are not to be ſaſtned to the Ribbs of any Veſſel I do not apprehend. But let us proceed to ſomewhat of more moment. Laſtly, that draws towards an end, <hi>Voſſius</hi> out of his malicious ſpirit againſt <hi>Simon,</hi> endeavours to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon him, while he equals him to <hi>Spinoſa</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> in thoſe things which he aſſerts concerning the uncertainty of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> However, by and by, as it were correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, he confeſſes ingeniouſly that <hi>Spinoſa</hi> was deſervedly condenm'd by <hi>Simon</hi> as unlearned, and with frivolous Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denying the receiv'd Authors to be the real Authors of thoſe Books. But they ſhew themſelves more unlearned then <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> who preſently think the Books of Scripture new writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Perſons whoſe Names they bear. The vile and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous part of <hi>Spinoſa</hi> is to be condemned; but therefore all that he ſpeaks concerning the Sacred Scripture is not preſently to be condemn'd; becauſe he agrees in ſome things with men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Piety and Learning. But whereas in this part <hi>Simon</hi> has not only diſtaſted the moſt Learned <hi>Voſſius,</hi> but alſo ſome other perſons of no leſs Note, who have not forbore to Vomit forth their moſt virulent Poyſon againſt his <hi>Critiea Sacra,</hi> it will not be amiſs to clear the truth of that Argument a little more plainly.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, there is nothing that <hi>Simon</hi> has written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the publick Notaries of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation, but what theſe Diminitive Saint and nice Stomack'd Scholiaſticks are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly offended at. For thoſe publick Regiſters, they toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and ſome of the Fathers call Prophets, who not only committed to Writing the Tranſactions of their own Times, but alſo took care of thoſe Books which were written by the former Prophets and were kept in the publick Regiſtries, almoſt in the ſame manner as <hi>Eſdras</hi> is ſaid to have reveiw'd the Sacred Writings after the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to have put them into that method which is ſtill obſerv'd both by the Jews and Chriſtians. There is nothing in this Aſſertion of <hi>Simon,</hi> which has not been approv'd by moſt of the Fathers and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50875:139"/>them the moſt Learned amongſt the Reſt. Read but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of ſingle <hi>Theodoret,</hi> one of the moſt Eminent Divines of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church, to the Book of Kings, where he explains the whole matter, and freely and without any ſcruple aſſerts, that there were ſeveral Prophets among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> of which every one was wont to Write the Tranſactions of his own Age, and that the greateſt part of thoſe Books are now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as is eaſie to be found in the Hiſtory of the Chronicles. He adds that thoſe Books which we call the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> were a long time after taken out of thoſe Books with <hi>Theodoretus,</hi>

But to make this matter yet more plain, it may be perhaps from the purpoſe to run over the ſeveral Books of Sacred Scripture, and to take a ſhort hint from every one.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt that appears is <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom the conſtant Tradition both of Jews and Chriſtians make to be the Author of the five Books of the Law. But as to him the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſeem to be the more religious, who maintain that there is not ſo much as one word, nay not ſo much as one ſyllable which did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, and was dictated to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Quite otherwiſe the moſt part of the Chriſtians, who affirm that ſome of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were added a long time after; either by <hi>Eſdras,</hi> or ſome others who had the overveiwing of them. Neither does St. <hi>Jerom</hi> preſume to attribute to <hi>Moſes</hi> ſome words of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> as it is now extant, following in this particular the common Opinion of the Doctors of the Church, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirm that the whole Law was review'd and corrected by <hi>Eſdras</hi> a moſt learned Scribe, <hi>Whether you will,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Jerom, that</hi> Moſes <hi>was the Author of the</hi> Pentateuch, <hi>or</hi> Eſdras <hi>the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, I will not gain ſay.</hi> But whether <hi>Moſes</hi> committed to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole Hiſtory which we have under his Name, or in part commanded it to be tranſcrib'd by the Notaries that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter'd the publick Tranſactions of his time, is the Queſtion. However, be it how it will, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall ſtill be thought the Author and Writer of the whole Law, as has been moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently obſerv'd by <hi>Simon,</hi> becauſe thoſe Scribes, if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50875:140"/>in his time, were wholly at his Devotion. And indeed we find nothing in the whole Law that does fix the Authority of thoſe ſort of Scribes. And yet had they not been conſtituted by <hi>Moſes</hi> from that very time, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Common-wealth had been deficient in what neither the <hi>Egyptians</hi> nor any other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nation wanted. Now that there were Writers of Annals ever ſince the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> the moſt Learned Jeſuit <hi>Sanctius</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove in theſe words.<note place="margin">Proleg. 4. in Paralip.</note> 
                     <hi>I beleive there were in the former Ages the words of Dayes, Commentaries, Ephemerides; and that there was diligent and ſedulous care, leaſt oblivion of Time ſhould obſcure the Nativities and Poſterity of Men conſiderable, which ſeems to me to have been certain from the very time of</hi> Moſes; I ſpare the names of others who have the ſame Sentiments. And I wonder that a late Writer, of the Order of the <hi>Seraphris,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with a <hi>Seraphic</hi> Zeal ſhould condemn, in his <hi>Biblic</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, this Opinion as Impious, and curſe the Authors of it. But as I am inform'd, that <hi>Seraphic</hi> Doctor, though he underſtands neither <hi>Latin</hi> nor <hi>Greek,</hi> is a perſon of moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ignorance and of the Sect of thoſe who <hi>blaſpheme what they underſtand not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude 8.</note> Some are offended, and perhaps the more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>Voſſius,</hi> for that <hi>Simon</hi> in his <hi>Critick's</hi> affirms, that ſome of the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were added afterwards.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50875:140"/>more obſcure or difficult then others occur'd, ſtuft here and there, into the Sacred Writings, for explanations ſake, ſome things of his own. Moreover ſeeing the Sacred Writings are propagated by ſo many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, that never ſo many Exemplars were ever known of any one Book, no wonder if what has happen'd upon other occaſions to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books ſhould happen to this, that ſome Notes added by Pious and Learned Men in the Margin, ſhould at length creep into the Text.</hi> Laſtly, thoſe relations at the end of <hi>Deutronomy</hi> concerning the Death and Burial of <hi>Moſes</hi> by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or rather by the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Grand <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> of which <hi>Joſhua</hi> was the Chief, are vulgarly thought to be added to the reſt of the Text. For it was the Cuſtom that the publick Tranſactions ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter'd in the publick Acts by thoſe who were appointed for that Employment; in which Sence <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have written ſome things in <hi>the Volume of the Law of the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>the Covenant which he had made with the People.</hi> To ſay truth there are many things extant in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which plainly declare that the Books of the Law were written by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus we read in <hi>Exodus,</hi> Moſes <hi>wrote all the words of the Lord.</hi> And in Deuteronomy; <hi>After</hi> Moſes <hi>had writ the words of the Law.</hi>

                     <hi>Some think that</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>others that</hi> Eſdras <hi>was the Author of both Books.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Books of <hi>Kings, Theodoret</hi> has made theſe Remarks upon them; That there were many Prophets among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> of which every one wrote the Tranſactions of his Age, and hence it came to paſs, that the firſt Book of <hi>Kings</hi> is call'd, both by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Syrians, The Propheſie of</hi> Samuel: ſoon after he adds, <hi>They therefore who wrote the Book of</hi> Kings, <hi>wrote them out of thoſe writings long after as their leizure ſerv'd them.</hi> And ſome while after he thus expreſſes himſelf, concerning the Books of the <hi>Chronicles.</hi> There were ſome other <hi>Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> who digeſted thoſe things that were omitted by others, which Book ſo written they call'd, <hi>Parah Pomona,</hi> the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As to the firſt and ſecond Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> which go under the Name of <hi>Samuel, Sixtus Senenſis</hi> adds theſe words: <hi>The Book of</hi> Samuel <hi>is ſaid to be written by the Prophet</hi> Samuel, <hi>partly by the Prophets</hi> Nathan <hi>and</hi> Gad. Samuel <hi>Collected the Acts of</hi> Eli, Saul, David, <hi>and his own, which are related in the firſt Book of</hi> Kings <hi>to his Death.</hi> Nathan <hi>and</hi> Gad <hi>wrote the Books of Kings from the Death of</hi> Samuel, <hi>to the end of the ſecond Book.</hi> What <hi>Sixtus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,</hi> writes in this place, though in general, I may not think them remote from Truth, yet if they be ſpecially weigh'd, they cannot be ſure in every part: for that as to all thoſe things which are related by <hi>Samuel</hi> to his <hi>Deaeth, many paſſages declare,</hi> that they could not be <hi>written by him.</hi> For it is hardly to be believ'd, that he writing of the <hi>Tranſactions</hi> of his own time, and of which he was
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50875:142"/>an eye-Witneſs, ſhould write theſe words. <hi>Therefore neither the Prieſt of</hi> Dagon,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.5.</note> 
                     <hi>nor any that come into the Houſe of</hi> Dagon, <hi>tread upon the Threſhold of</hi> Dagon <hi>to this day.</hi> In like manner neither could thoſe things be related by <hi>Samuel,</hi> concerning the <hi>Ark</hi> in the next Chapter, where it is ſaid, and the Stone remains in the Field of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the <hi>Beſhemite</hi> to this Day. To this we add, That <hi>Samuel</hi> could not be the Author of that Clauſe which we find in his Hiſtory. <hi>Heretofore to every one ſpake that went to take Counſel of God; for he that is at this day call'd a</hi> Prophet, <hi>was then call'd</hi> a Seer. However, notwithſtanding all theſe Objections, it is probable, that the Hiſtory which goes under <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Name was written by himſelf till the Relation of his Death. And as for thoſe things which are alleadg'd to the contrary, that there was a review of ſome Scribe, or Prophet, perhaps <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> as ſome think, who added ſome things for Explanations ſake; tho' others chooſe rather to add theſe Additions to <hi>Eſdras</hi> and his <hi>Collegiates.</hi> The <hi>Syrians</hi> alſo affirm, That the firſt and ſecond Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> were call'd the third and fourth in the <hi>Latin Verſions,</hi> were written by a certain Prieſt, whoſe Name was <hi>Johanan.</hi>

                  <p>The Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is by the <hi>Jews,</hi> call'd <hi>Sepher Techillim,</hi> or the Book of <hi>Praiſes,</hi> which ſometimes St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeems to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to have been all of <hi>David</hi>'s compoſing; nor does he ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to aſcribe thoſe to <hi>David,</hi> which it is manifeſt were written long after his time, becauſe he was both a Muſitian and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Nor could the Names of <hi>Aſaph, Jeduthun,</hi> and other Muſitians, ſaid to be the Authors of ſome of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> beat off St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> from that Opinion, becauſe that <hi>David</hi> might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Matter, which afterwards they poliſh'd and ſet to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tunes. But St. <hi>Jerome</hi> is more in the right, who aſſerts the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to be theirs, whoſe Names they bear in the Titles, that is <hi>Davids, Aſaph's, Jeduthuns,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Core's, Eman's</hi> the <hi>Ezra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hite, Moſes's, Solomon's,</hi> and theirs whom <hi>Eſdras</hi> comprehends in the firſt Volume: with St. <hi>Jerom</hi> alſo moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> agree.

                     </note> though there are ſome who have no Name at all.

                  <p>The Book which is called the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> is generally ſaid to be <hi>Solomons,</hi> whoſe Name it carries at the beginning; though the whole Method of that Work ſeems to demonſtrate, that it was nothing but a Collection of Sentences, which being firſt gather'd together by <hi>Solomon</hi> and others, were afterwards embody'd in one Volume; That <hi>Solomon</hi> compoſed many Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thoſe words prove, which he ſpeaks of himſelf.<note place="margin">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50875:143"/>the Preacher was wiſe he ſtill taught the people knowledge, he ſought out and ſet in order many Proverbs, which are number'd up to be above three thouſand in the third Book of Kings,</hi> of which at this day no more are extant then what we find in the Holy Writings.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The third part of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> begins from theſe Words of the 25th. Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>It is the Glory of God to conceal a thing.</hi> Which diſtinction was made by them, who reduc'd the Books of Scripture into that Order which is now obſerv'd: for it is not to be believ'd, that <hi>Solomon</hi> fix'd his Name to his <hi>Proverbs,</hi> but only the Scribes who divided that Work into parts: And ſo, that Verſe which we read at the beginning of the 25th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Theſe are the Proverbs of</hi> Solomon, <hi>which the Men of</hi> Ezekiah <hi>King of</hi> Judah <hi>Copyed out.

And indeed, I am ready to believe, that <hi>Sobna,</hi> and others of King <hi>Ezekia</hi>'s Scribes, did extract out of the whole Volume thoſe Sentences, of which the firſt is, <hi>the Glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. and this the Word, <hi>which the Men of</hi> Ezekiah <hi>Copy'd,</hi> clearly demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>The fourth part of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> begin at the beginning of the 30th. Chapter; where we read in the <hi>Latin</hi> Edition, <hi>the Words of the Aſſembler,</hi> but in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, <hi>the Words of Agur.</hi> But who that <hi>Agur</hi> and <hi>Aſſembler</hi> was, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Scripture do not agree among themſelves. The ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>R. Solomon</hi> teſtifies, will have <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo call'd, as if we ſhould ſay a <hi>Collector</hi> or <hi>Aſſembler</hi> of Sentences, for that <hi>Agar</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies to Collect: the Senſe of which the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Interpreter has render'd in Tranſlating it, <hi>the Words of the Collector or Aſſembler.</hi> The ſame Opinion <hi>R. Levy Ben Gerſon</hi> il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates, where he ſays, <hi>Solomon ſeems to have given himſelf the Name of</hi> Agur, in reſpect of the Sentences which he has Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in this Book. But perhaps <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, with more reaſon ſuſpects this <hi>Agur,</hi> to have been the <hi>Theognes</hi> or <hi>Phocylledes</hi> of thoſe Times, out of whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>Solomon</hi> might Collect ſome Sentences, which he digeſted into one Volume with other Proverbs. Laſtly, there is a fifth part of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> contained within the 31ſt. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50875:143"/>which is the laſt, and that under the Name of King <hi>Lemuel;</hi> who that <hi>Lemuel</hi> was is not known. Moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> believe, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is meant thereby, as Chriſt is intended by the word <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> aſſerts: and the reaſon of that Appellation he takes from hence, for that <hi>Lemuel</hi> ſignifies <hi>God with them</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the Reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> teſtifies, one God was worſhipt among the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But there is no reaſon we ſhould be ſollicitous about the Word <hi>Lemuel,</hi> eſpecially when the Seventy ſay nothing of it, and as they read, ſo they have Tranſlated the words of the Context quite after another manner.</p>
                  <p>As for the Book which in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is call'd, <hi>Cobaleth,</hi> and by Us <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> it is call'd <hi>Concionator,</hi> or the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> though moſt of the latter <hi>Jews</hi> will have <hi>Cobeleth</hi> to ſignifie a perſon, that Collects, becauſe that Book contains ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs upon ſundry Occaſions.

                  <p>By who the Hiſtory was written, that is entituled <hi>Eſther,</hi> is uncertain; but as to the time when it was written, almoſt all the Jews and Chriſtians agree: For whether the Authors of it were the <hi>Senators</hi> of the <hi>Grand Synagogue,</hi> as the <hi>Talmudic</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors believe; or <hi>Eſdras,</hi> which is the Opinion of the Fathers; or <hi>Mordecai,</hi> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> more probably believes, and the Book it ſelf ſeems to teſtifie, there is no diſpute about the time when it was written. Therefore <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> does not conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture amiſs, when he ſays that <hi>Eſdras</hi> added to his own, and the Book which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> wrote, <hi>The Hiſtory of Eſther,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the middle of thoſe Times, of which the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are related in thoſe Books, and which <hi>Grotius</hi> alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to have been written by <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Songs</hi> had no other Author than <hi>Salomon,</hi> the very Title it ſelf declares; and it is certain from the third Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> that the ſame <hi>Salomon</hi> compoſed both <hi>Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Songs:</hi> But this, becauſe it was the beſt of <hi>Salomon's</hi> Songs was therefore called <hi>The Song of Songs,</hi> that is to ſay, the moſt Excellent Song. Yet ſome do queſtion, whether it were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Salomon,</hi> as it is now extant, or whether it were cull'd out of the whole Volume of his Songs. However for that Song, wherein <hi>Salomon</hi> is introduced, diſcourſing with the <hi>Sunamite,</hi> as a Bridegroom with a Bride is very difficult to explain, not only by reaſon of the Expreſſions ſomewhat over confident, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Similitudes, which our Cuſtoms will by no means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; but alſo becauſe the Names of the <hi>Interlocutors</hi> are not ſet done, for beſides <hi>Salomon</hi> and his Spouſe, there are two <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s of young <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Virgins.</hi>

                  <p>But 'tis a ſtrange thing, how the <hi>Rabbies</hi> differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> The <hi>Talmudics</hi> believe it to be no relation of real matter of Fact; but that it is a Fiction or Parable to ſet forth a moſt exact and high Example of Piety and Patience, and with theſe ſome of the Chriſtians agree. Nay there were ſome who did not only believe the Argument of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50875:144"/>work to be feigned, but will have the Name of <hi>Job</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of thoſe Letters of the firſt Verſe of the third Chapter of the Book, where we read <hi>Jobad Jom, he curſt the day.</hi> For all that went before they looked upon only as a Prologue. But the Teſtimony of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who makes mention of <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> demonſtrates that the Name of <hi>Job</hi> is not fictitious; and the prudent <hi>Aben Azra</hi> moſt ſharply rebukes thoſe who are of that Opinion: He alſo believes him to have been of the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> which he gathers from the Name of the Place,<note place="margin">Com. in 1 cap. <hi>Job.</hi>
                     </note> where he was born. Beſides the Names of <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, and other Circumſtances plainly evidence, that the ſtory was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true, according as it is related, though it contains many things which are much more like Parable than Truth of Hiſtory. But as to the Author of it, there is no certainty, ſome apply it to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſome to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> others to <hi>Job,</hi> himſelf, and his Friends. Nor do they agree among themſelves, who make <hi>Moſes</hi> to be the Author of it; ſome believing that it was only a Tranſlation of his into Hebrew, out of ſome Forreign Language. But letting theſe things paſs, if we may conjecture in a matter ſo obſcure, I believe they are neareſt the Truth, who fix the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this Piece in the Time of the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity.</hi> For the Language is hardly Hebrew, and abounding in Chaldee Phraſes, beſpeaks a Perſon, who by Forreign Converſe, had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his Hebrew Speech. In which Senſe the words of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> are to be explained, when he tells us, <hi>That he Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Job out of the Hebrew, Arabic and Syriac Language.</hi> To which we may add, that the Jews, whoſe Affairs were then in a deſperate Condition, took great Delight in reading that Book as the Comfort of their Afflictions. Therefore the Author relates an Action that lately happed; and becauſe he takes upon him to perform the part of a Poet, tho the Argument be not fictitious, yet he makes uſe of Figures and florid Language, mixing ſometimes Probabilities with Truth, obſerving only a <hi>Decorum</hi> between the <hi>Interlocutors.</hi>

                  <p>The Prophets by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> are call'd <hi>Pronouncers</hi> or <hi>Publiſhers</hi> of the word of God to Men.

Proph.</note> who committed to Writing the Predictions of the Prophets as they receiv'd them from their own Lips: as if the Prophets had not wont to write down the Sermons which they made to the People. The ſame obſervation <hi>Cornelius a Lapide</hi> makes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Propheſie of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who believe that <hi>Baruch,</hi> who was the Scribe belonging to that Prophet collected all his Propheſies which he had preach'd at ſundry times and embody'd them into one Volume, not regarding the Order of time wherein they were preach'd. And <hi>John Calvin</hi> himſelf confeſſes that the Propheſies of the Prophets never came to our hands digeſted into that order as they ought to have been: nevertheleſs he does not believe it any derogation to their Inſpiration, <hi>They,</hi>

                     </note> ſaith he, <hi>who have diligently and judiciouſly convers'd with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, will grant me, that their Sermons were never digeſted into that method, as they ought to have been; but as Opportunity offer'd ſo the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50875:145"/>Volume was perfected.</hi> He believes that the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were preſerv'd by the diligence of the Preiſt, whoſe Duty it was to recommend the Propheſies to Poſterity, though the Preiſts were profeſt Enemies to the Prophets. The ſame <hi>Calvin</hi> writes alſo, that after the Prophets had Preach'd to the People, they wrote out the Heads of it, which was affix'd to the Doors of the Temple that all people might read them, which being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards taken away by the Officers of the Temple, was laid up in the Treaſury for a perpetual Monument and Record of that Sermon, from whence he conjectures that the Books of the Prophets now extant were Copy'd. True it is, that from the words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Habaccuc,</hi> whom <hi>Calvin</hi> produces for his Witneſſes, this one thing ſeems eaſie to be prov'd, that the Prophets wrote their Sermons plainly and legibly upon Tables, that they might be read by all the people: But of the Doors of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to which he believes they were affix'd, they make no mention at all. Then again he Conjectures amiſs, that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries of the Sermons were only Copyed out, and not the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons at length. Though there is no skilfull <hi>Critic</hi> who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aver, that the Propheſies which we have now are entire. The ſame <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> farther conjecture, that the Inſcriptions which declare the Names of the Prophets, and the Years when the Propheſies were pronounced, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Prieſts, whoſe Duty it was to keep them ſafe, for the ſatisfaction of Poſterity. Theſe are their Words: <hi>Il ſemble che ces Tiltres ayent estez adjouſtez aux Revelations des Prophetes par les ſacrificateurs et Levites, qui avoit charge de garder les Prophetes au Treſor du Temple apres qu' elles avoient eſte propoſees au Peuple, ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant le contume des Prophetes. It ſeems probable, that the Titles were added to the Revelations of the Prophets by the Prieſts and Levites, who had the charge of thoſe Propheſies in the Treaſury of the Temple, after they had been expoſed to the people according to the cuſtome of the Prophets:</hi> To which Opinion <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> alſo gives his Vote. There is only this difference between him and them, that he does not attribute theſe Inſcriptions to the Prieſts and Levites, but to the Men of the great Synagogue, who collected the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets, and ſet down the time of their being written. This ſeems more probable, becauſe it is taken for granted among all, that the Senate where <hi>Eſdras</hi> preſided, did add ſomething to the Sacred Text by way of Connexion and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50875:146"/>Explication. Thus alſo <hi>Thomas</hi> believes that the Inſcriptions fix'd to ſome <hi>Pſalms</hi> were inſerted by <hi>Eſdras,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Com. in</hi> Pſal. 6.</note> and were done, <hi>partly as things were then acted, partly according to what happned.</hi> Laſtly it is is very probable that thoſe Hiſtories which are inſerted in ſome of the Sermons of the Prophets were added by the ſame Senators, when they review'd the Sacred Books, and form'd the Canonical Scripture as now we have it, which is the reaſon ſome believe thoſe words were inſerted in the 51. <hi>Jeremie. Thus far the words of Jeremie.</hi> Which conclude the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Prophet, in regard the following Chapter is no Propheſie, but a Hiſtory taken out of the end of the 4th Book of <hi>Kings.</hi> And in this the <hi>Rabbies</hi> agree with moſt of the Chriſtian Doctors. For <hi>R.D. Kimchi</hi> teſtifies that thoſe words which run on to the end of the Propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> do not belong to the Propheſie, only that he who Copy'd the Book inſerted here the ſtory of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,<note place="margin">Com. in c. <hi>51. Jer.</hi>
                     </note> as it is in the end of the Book of <hi>Kings.</hi> On the otherſide, <hi>Abravanel</hi> conjectures that <hi>Eſdras</hi> or the Senators of the Grand Aſſembly, were the Authors of that Supplement, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Ezechia</hi> was tranferr'd out of the 2 Book of <hi>Kings, cap.</hi> 18. into the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> From all that has been ſaid, it may be eaſily diſcern'd who were accompted Prophets among the <hi>Hebrew</hi> People, what was their Office and Function, and what their method of writing. Moreover this alſo ſeems worthy Obſervation, that the Prophets did not only preach to the People, and foretel future events, but alſo digeſted the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their times, and wrote them into the publick Records. And thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> who wrote the Acts of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> bears the Title no leſs of a Hiſtorian then a Prophet, or rather the name of Prophet among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> comprehends all thoſe ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So that whoever was a revealer of the Divine will, or foretold future Accidents, or wrote the Tranſlations of his Time, was call'd a Prophet. From whence queſtionleſs it came to paſs that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> adorn'd the Hiſtories of <hi>Joſhua, Judges, Samuel</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> with the Titles of <hi>Neviion</hi> Prophets, becauſe they were written by Perſons who being full of the Holy Spirit, were call'd <hi>Prophets.</hi> In which ſence <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms, that in his Nation, Books were not written by every one, but by Prophets only. <hi>Jonathan</hi> alſo has rightly underſtood the force of that word, who inſtead of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:50875:146"/>word <hi>Navi</hi> Prophet, ſometimes mixes another word in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe which ſignifies only Scribe; as if Prophets were the ſame with Scribes. And thus much concerning the Sacred Writers. I paſs by the <hi>Apocriphal</hi> Books which the <hi>Jews</hi> do not admit into their Canonical Number, becauſe their Authors, as the word <hi>Apocryphal</hi> ſignifies, are uncertain, and hidden in obſcurity. Let the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Voſſius</hi> therefore forbear to bark at the moſt worthy <hi>Simon,</hi> a Perſon ſo well deſerving of the Sacred Scriptures, who has publiſh'd nothing concerning the Writers of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> but what has been already approv'd by Perſons moſt Grave and ſolid, and highly Eminent both for their Piety and Learning, <hi>Into a wicked Heart Wiſdom ſhall not enter.</hi>
